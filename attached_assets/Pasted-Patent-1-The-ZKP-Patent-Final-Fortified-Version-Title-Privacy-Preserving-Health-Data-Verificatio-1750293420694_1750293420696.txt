BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] This invention relates to computer-implemented systems and methods for privacy-preserving verification of health-related data. More particularly, it relates to cryptographic proof systems, including zero-knowledge proofs, that enable verification of biometric data and medical compliance parameters without exposing the underlying raw data, supporting scalable, regulation-compliant third-party validation.

Description of the Related Art
[0002] Current health data verification systems—including self-reporting mobile applications, centralized electronic health records (EHR), and third-party validation services—require transmission, inspection, and often centralized storage of raw biometric data such as heart rate, glucose levels, activity metrics, and sleep logs. This widespread exposure of personal health data introduces significant privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges. Existing approaches rely heavily on manual review, trusted intermediaries, and central authorities, creating single points of failure and making them vulnerable to fraud, misuse, and non-compliance with data minimization mandates. These limitations are further exacerbated in distributed or large-scale deployments where privacy risks and validation costs scale unfavorably.

[0003] Moreover, such systems lack scalable cryptographic mechanisms to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and compliance of biometric data without revealing the underlying inputs. Data integrity is often assumed rather than cryptographically proven, leading to unverifiable claims in health assessments, wellness incentives, or insurance submissions. Existing platforms do not support fine-grained constraint validation logic—such as ensuring physiological plausibility, temporal sequencing, or jurisdiction-aware health compliance rules—within a privacy-preserving framework. These deficiencies create friction in health data sharing, limit automation, and expose providers and verifiers to compliance liability under laws such as GDPR Article 5 and HIPAA's minimum necessary standard.

[0004] No existing framework supports dynamic constraint enforcement—including biological plausibility, real-time temporal validation, and policy-based geographic adjustments—while maintaining compliance with GDPR's data minimization and HIPAA's minimum necessary rules. Moreover, existing systems lack a unified mechanism for decentralized, auditable health proof validation using blockchain anchoring and selective disclosure. This invention solves these deficiencies by introducing a zero-knowledge proof system specifically tailored for health data validation, built on constraint satisfaction circuits that validate biometric data without disclosure while supporting cryptographically verifiable assertion of compliance requirements across physiological thresholds, temporal behaviors, and geographic exposure criteria.

[0005] Prior systems have explored zero-knowledge techniques for data validation and identity management: US20150066867A1 (Chen et al.) introduces a method for zero-knowledge attestation validation, enabling the verification of statements between primary and authority accounts without revealing their identities. This system employs a multi-key cryptographic mechanism with RSA-based public-private key pairs to facilitate anonymous validation across separate databases, primarily targeting financial transaction verification. The system operates through a three-party protocol involving attestation servers, verification nodes, and client applications, but lacks health-specific constraint validation or biometric data handling capabilities. US20220200975A1 (Kumar et al.) details a method for zero-knowledge private key management within decentralized applications using zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). It focuses on creating identity smart contracts and managing validator networks to authenticate users without exposing private keys, enhancing identity verification on blockchain networks through Merkle tree-based proof systems and elliptic curve cryptography.

[0006] While these inventions contribute to privacy-preserving data validation and identity management, they do not address the specific challenges associated with health data verification. Chen et al.'s system, while employing sophisticated multi-key cryptography, operates exclusively within centralized database architectures and cannot handle the complex physiological constraints required for biometric validation (e.g., heart rate variability thresholds, glucose trend analysis, sleep pattern validation). Kumar et al.'s blockchain-based approach, despite utilizing advanced zk-SNARK protocols, lacks the computational framework necessary for real-time biometric data processing and cannot support the environmental parameter adjustments essential for accurate health metric validation. Neither system provides: dynamic adjustment of constraint parameters based on environmental factors such as altitude, temperature, and circadian rhythms; jurisdiction-aware compliance that automatically aligns with regional health regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) using geolocation metadata; operation in resource-constrained or disconnected environments, such as military deployments or remote medical facilities, where real-time connectivity is limited; integration with health-specific data sources including wearable devices, mobile health applications, and medical sensor networks; and the ability to generate zero-knowledge proofs that validate physiological plausibility, temporal consistency, and regulatory compliance constraints without exposing raw biometric data.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007] The present invention provides a system and method for privacy-preserving verification of biometric health data using zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs. Biometric data is collected alongside environmental metadata, which may include geographic location, altitude, activity level, and jurisdictional identifiers. A constraint validation module determines a set of physiological constraints by retrieving rules from a machine-readable database that encodes legal, environmental, and medical standards. These constraints are used to configure a cryptographic circuit, from which a computationally efficient zero-knowledge proof is generated attesting to compliance without revealing underlying biometric values. The system supports local proof generation on mobile and edge devices using lightweight or sparse constraint models. A blockchain anchoring module records a hash of the proof in a tamper-resistant, timestamped transaction. A consent management module records user authorization events to the blockchain, and a smart contract-based verification interface allows authorized third parties to validate the proof by checking both cryptographic integrity and consent validity. The invention further enables conjunctive aggregation of multiple constraint validations into a unified proof and supports quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives. This architecture enables context-sensitive, regulation-aligned, and privacy-preserving third-party validation of health compliance in fields including medical credentialing, wellness screening, military readiness, and insurance claims.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0036] The present invention overcomes the deficiencies outlined in the prior art section by introducing a dynamic constraint validation mechanism that adjusts physiological thresholds based on environmental metadata such as altitude, location, time zone, or detected activity level. This adaptive constraint logic is used to configure the cryptographic circuit employed by the zero-knowledge proof engine, ensuring that the proof reflects contextually appropriate health criteria without exposing underlying data. When combined with blockchain-based consent anchoring and smart contract-based validation, the system enables a scalable, privacy-preserving compliance verification architecture capable of reflecting both medical accuracy and user autonomy.

[0037] Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–170), the system comprises a privacy-preserving health data verification architecture designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs from biometric input without exposing unencrypted or personally identifiable biometric data. A data intake module (110) collects biometric and health-related data from heterogeneous sources such as wearable devices, mobile health applications, electronic health records (EHR), and environmental sensors. An environmental metadata module (120) captures contextual information including altitude, climate, and geographic location. A constraint validation module (130) evaluates this input against physiological plausibility, temporal consistency, and jurisdiction-specific compliance rules. For example, if the environmental metadata (120) indicates an altitude of 10,000 feet, the constraint validation module (130) is configured to retrieve a corresponding adjustment factor from a stored lookup table and modify the acceptable physiological range for oxygen saturation from a baseline of "95%-100%" to a context-specific range of "88%-95%". This adjusted range is then passed as a public input to the zero-knowledge proof engine (140). The zero-knowledge proof engine (140) generates proofs attesting to compliance using this constraint satisfaction logic, without revealing underlying data. A blockchain anchoring module (150) immutably records the generated proofs on a distributed ledger. The entire system is secured within a trusted execution environment (160), while a verification interface (170) enables third parties to validate the proof without accessing the original biometric input.

[0038] Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–270), the constraint validation pipeline is shown in the context of a military readiness verification use case. Biometric data from a soldier's wearable device is processed through a multi-stage logic sequence that evaluates physiological thresholds (210), chronological ordering (220), environmental metadata (240), and jurisdictional policy parameters (250). For instance, to verify fitness for duty, a command authority (a verifier) may require a proof that a soldier has achieved at least four hours of restful sleep (defined as average heart rate below a specified threshold) within the last 24 hours. The circadian rhythm validator (230) can be invoked to ensure these sleep hours occurred during a valid rest period relative to the local time zone of the operational theater, information supplied by the environmental metadata module (240). The pipeline confirms that the data is chronologically sound to prevent replay attacks and that the physiological data is plausible for the given operational environment (e.g., accounting for higher exertion levels). The output is a single, verifiable proof of readiness that satisfies the command's requirements without exposing the soldier's specific, minute-by-minute biometric history.

[0039] Referring to FIG. 3 (Components 300–370), the internal architecture of the zero-knowledge proof engine is illustrated in the context of a health insurance wellness program that benefits both the insurer and the insured. In this use case, an insurer offers a premium discount to a policyholder for verifiably managing a chronic condition, such as maintaining an average blood glucose level below a target for 90 days. The public inputs (310) would be the non-sensitive rules of the wellness program, such as the target glucose range and the 90-day compliance period set by the insurer. The encrypted private biometric inputs (320) are the policyholder's daily glucose readings, which are kept confidential and never shared with the insurer. The cryptographic scheme selection module (330) chooses an appropriate proof type, such as a zk-SNARK or Bulletproof, to process the private readings against the public constraints. The engine then generates a cryptographic proof that confirms the policyholder's compliance, enabling them to receive the discount without revealing any specific daily measurements. This allows the insurer to reduce risk based on verifiable health management, while the insured gains a financial reward without sacrificing data privacy. Strict privacy boundaries are enforced to ensure the proof reveals no information beyond compliance, and the engine is optimized for real-time proof generation on the user's mobile device. This architecture illustrates a key distinction of the invention, wherein environmental metadata is used to define the core logic of the cryptographic circuit itself, rather than serving as a simple public input to a static proof system.

[0040] Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–470), the blockchain anchoring process is detailed in the context of a credentialing use case that benefits both a traveling nurse and a hiring hospital. To streamline onboarding, the nurse must provide proof of time-sensitive health records, such as an annual negative tuberculosis test. The timestamping module (410) is used to cryptographically prove the date the test result was validated, allowing the hospital to instantly confirm it is within the required 12-month window. The immutability enforcement module (420) ensures this anchored proof cannot be altered or tampered with, giving the hospital confidence in its authenticity. As the nurse updates her credentials annually, the version control mechanism (430) creates a longitudinal, auditable history of her compliance. Crucially, the consent record integration module (440) associates the proof with the nurse's explicit authorization, allowing a specific hospital to verify her records for a limited time. This empowers the nurse by giving her control over her private data while allowing the hospital to automate and accelerate credentialing. This entire process can be implemented via various anchoring strategies, including Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2 networks for lower costs, or hybrid architectures combining off-chain storage with on-chain proof hashes.

[0041] Referring to FIG. 5 (Components 500–570), the third-party verification interface enables decentralized proof validation within a corporate wellness program, benefiting both the employer and employee. In this scenario, an employer offers a monthly insurance premium discount to employees who prove they averaged a certain number of steps per day. The employer's HR system, acting as the verifier, uses a secure API (510) to request validation of the employee's proof. Alternatively, a smart contract (520) could be used to automatically trigger the premium discount upon receiving a valid proof. The system confirms compliance without exposing the underlying biometric data, meaning the employer never sees the employee's specific daily step counts, walking routes, or other sensitive health information. This architecture supports selective disclosure, where an employee can prove they met the step-count goal for their employer while using the same underlying health data to prove they met a separate cardiovascular goal for their insurer. This process provides significant value across other applications, including research compliance and public health enforcement.

[0042] Referring to FIG. 6 (Components 600–670), the privacy and consent lifecycle management module is detailed in the context of a public health research use case during a pandemic, which benefits both researchers and the general public. To track the spread of a virus, researchers can request proofs from the population for specific, anonymous data points (e.g., "prove you have a fever and are in a specific zip code"). The module's consent grant and revocation logic (610) empowers individuals to contribute to this research by granting explicit, temporary consent for their anonymized data to be used, which they can withdraw at any time. The audit trail mechanism (640) immutably logs these consent actions, creating public trust and regulatory transparency. For a global pandemic, the jurisdictional constraint enforcement (620) is critical, automatically ensuring that data handling complies with regional privacy laws like GDPR in Europe and HIPAA in the U.S. Furthermore, upon consent revocation or the conclusion of a study, secure deletion processes (630) are triggered to honor the "right to be forgotten." This trustworthy framework encourages widespread public participation, allowing researchers to gather vital, verifiable data at scale and accelerate a scientific response that protects the health of the masses.

[0043] Referring to FIG. 7 (Components 700–770), the system architecture's critical importance is demonstrated in a military edge deployment scenario. A soldier's wearable sensors and ruggedized mobile device (710, 720) are equipped with the lightweight ZK proof engine (730). This engine is specifically designed for local proof generation, allowing it to operate directly on the constrained hardware without relying on a network connection. The engine locally generates a proof attesting that the soldier's vital signs meet mission-ready parameters (e.g., "core body temperature is within safe limits and heart rate variability indicates non-fatigued state") without exposing the specific biometric data on insecure tactical networks. This capability for real-time local proof generation in disconnected or bandwidth-limited conditions is a direct result of the engine's lightweight design, which minimizes computational and memory overhead. The immutable proof is stored securely on the device, and the blockchain anchoring is deferred (760, 770) until the soldier returns to a command post with network access, at which point the proof is anchored to create a permanent health record. This architecture is indispensable for high-stakes environments where immediate, cryptographically secure health verification is required but connectivity cannot be guaranteed.

[0044] It is a key aspect of the present invention that the dynamic adjustment of constraints based on environmental metadata represents a specific technical improvement over prior systems. While some systems may use contextual data, such as location, as a simple public input to a fixed cryptographic proof, the present invention distinguishes itself by fundamentally reconfiguring the physiological constraint parameters that define the arithmetic circuit of the zero-knowledge proof itself. Unlike logistical data such as location, physiological data possesses inherent biological plausibility ranges that themselves fluctuate based on environmental conditions. The described method addresses the unique challenge of encoding these fluctuating biological rules into the structure of the cryptographic proof, a problem not contemplated by general-purpose context-aware verification systems.

ABSTRACT
A system and method for privacy-preserving verification of health data are disclosed. The system includes a data intake module for receiving biometric input and associated environmental metadata. A constraint validation module dynamically determines physiological constraint parameters, retrieved from a machine-readable rules database that encodes medically established physiological plausibility criteria, jurisdiction-specific compliance logic, and constraint thresholds. A computationally efficient zero-knowledge proof engine generates a cryptographic proof using a dynamically configured cryptographic circuit, which attests to compliance with the determined parameters without revealing the underlying health data. The system further supports conjunctive aggregation of multiple constraint validations into a single proof. A blockchain anchoring module records a hash of the proof, and a smart contract-enabled consent management module records user authorization events to the blockchain. These consent records govern access via a verification interface, enabling authorized third parties to securely and auditable validate the cryptographic proof, confirming both physiological and jurisdictional compliance, including in resource-constrained edge deployments.
