Amended Claim 1 (Method Claim)
A computer-implemented method for privacy-preserving verification of health data, comprising: (a) receiving, at a hardware processor, biometric data from a sensor and associated environmental metadata; (b) selecting, by the hardware processor, a set of physiological constraint parameters from a data store based on said environmental metadata; (c) generating, by the hardware processor, a zero-knowledge proof from the biometric data using a cryptographic circuit defined by the selected set of physiological constraint parameters, wherein the proof verifies that the biometric data satisfies the constraints without revealing the biometric data; (d) anchoring a hash of the zero-knowledge proof to a blockchain ledger to create an immutable and tamper-evident entry; and (e) providing, via a verification interface, third-party access to the anchored proof hash for verification.
Why This Is Stronger:

Replaces Functional Steps: It replaces vague functional steps like "validating the data using constraint logic" with the specific, structural process of (b) selecting parameters from a data store and (c) generating a proof using a circuit defined by those parameters.
Defeats Abstractness: This describes a concrete series of computer operations, making it much more difficult for an examiner to reject as an abstract idea under ยง101. It claims a specific how, not just a general what.
Increases Definiteness: The claim is unambiguous. Each step has a clear input and output, directly addressing potential indefiniteness rejections under ยง112.
Amended Claim 10 (System Claim)
A system for privacy-preserving verification of biometric data, comprising: (a) a data intake module configured to receive biometric input from a sensor and associated environmental metadata; (b) a constraint validation module communicatively coupled to the data intake module and configured to select a set of physiological constraint parameters from a memory based on the received environmental metadata; (c) a zero-knowledge proof engine communicatively coupled to the constraint validation module and configured to generate a proof from the biometric input using a cryptographic circuit defined by the selected set of physiological constraint parameters, wherein the proof verifies compliance without revealing the biometric input; (d) a blockchain anchoring module configured to record a hash of the proof on a distributed ledger; and (e) a verification interface comprising a smart contract or secure API configured to enable third-party validation by comparing a submitted proof to the recorded proof hash.
Why This Is Stronger:

Claims a Concrete Machine: This claim now defines a "machine" not by its goals, but by its structure. The modules are defined by their specific configuration and how they are communicatively coupled to perform a structural task (selecting parameters, defining a circuit).
Mirrors Method Claim: It closely mirrors the structure of the amended method claim, creating strong consistency throughout the application.
Clear Boundaries: The interactions between the modules are clearly defined, leaving little room for an examiner to argue that the claim scope is unclear.
