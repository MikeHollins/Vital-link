BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

[0001] This invention relates to computer-implemented methods for health data verification, specifically cryptographic proof systems that enable verification of health data and medical compliance criteria without exposing sensitive personal health information.

Description of the Related Art

[0002] It is an object of the present invention to provide a privacy-preserving method for verifying biometric data compliance without disclosing underlying health information; to replace trust-based reporting systems with cryptographic verification mechanisms; to enable scalable third-party health data validation using zero-knowledge proofs; to reduce fraud in wellness programs, insurance claims, and public health initiatives; and to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks including HIPAA, GDPR, and jurisdiction-specific privacy laws.

[0003] Current health data verification systems—including self-reporting mobile applications, centralized electronic health records (EHR), and third-party reporting—require transmission and inspection of raw biometric data such as heart rate, sleep metrics, and activity levels. This exposes sensitive personal data and creates major privacy, regulatory, and security risks. Most systems rely on manual validation, trusted intermediaries, or centralized data collection, all of which are vulnerable to fraud, incompatible with modern privacy standards, and unsuitable for large-scale or adversarial deployments.

[0004] Furthermore, existing systems lack cryptographic assurances of data integrity and compliance. Studies show that self-reported health data introduces fraud rates exceeding 20%, especially in wellness incentive programs. Manual methods are slow, expensive, and fail to meet auditability and data minimization mandates under GDPR Article 5 and HIPAA’s minimum necessary provisions.

[0005] No existing framework offers a cryptographically verifiable method for asserting that biometric data meets compliance requirements—such as physiological thresholds, temporal behaviors, or geographic exposure criteria—while preserving privacy, preventing data tampering, and enabling scalable third-party validation. This invention solves these deficiencies by introducing a zero-knowledge proof system specifically tailored for health data validation, built on constraint satisfaction logic, jurisdiction-aware compliance profiles, and blockchain-based audit mechanisms.

[0006] The system architecture supports deployment across mobile, cloud, wearable, and edge devices, including disconnected or resource-constrained environments such as military operations, remote field medicine, orbital platforms, and employer wellness programs. It includes real-time constraint adaptation based on biometric trends, environmental metadata (e.g., altitude, climate, GPS), and automatic selection of regulatory frameworks based on IP location or user profile. Privacy enforcement features include user consent capture, audit logging, zero-knowledge aggregation, and compliance with right-to-erasure mandates. Support for secure hardware enclaves (e.g., TEE, TPM, SGX), GPU acceleration, and quantum-resistant protocols enables scalable and tamper-resistant proof generation across adversarial or disconnected networks.
