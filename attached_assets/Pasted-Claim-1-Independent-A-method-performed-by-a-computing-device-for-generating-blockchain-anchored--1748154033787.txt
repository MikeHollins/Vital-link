Claim 1 (Independent):
A method performed by a computing device for generating blockchain-anchored, privacy-preserving health data tokens, comprising:  

receiving verified health data and achievement attestations from trusted health monitoring sources and medical systems;
automatically sanitizing said data using trained pattern recognition and machine learning models to redact protected health information (PHI) and identifiers, without disclosing detailed health measurements;
encoding achievement metadata in a standardized format using healthcare ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) that describe health outcomes and attestations without revealing measurement specifics;
cryptographically committing to the sanitized data and achievement metadata using commitment schemes suitable for zero-knowledge proof generation;
minting blockchain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) compliant with ERC-721 or similar standards, embedding cryptographic commitments and metadata; and
supporting marketplace trading, revenue sharing, and regulatory features—including user data erasure and cryptographic proof validation—across multiple blockchain networks.
Claim 2 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the sanitization employs machine learning classifiers trained on healthcare datasets to accurately detect and redact PHI, identifiers, and sensitive health information, achieving over 99% accuracy.

Claim 3 (Dependent):

Claim 4 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic commitments are designed to support zero-knowledge proofs, enabling third-party verification of achievement attestations without revealing underlying health data.

Claim 5 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the minting includes generating time-locked NFTs that require demonstration of sustained health behaviors over predefined periods before being valid for marketplace transfer.

Claim 6 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the system supports cross-chain interoperability, allowing health data tokens to be securely traded and verified across multiple blockchain protocols.

Claim 7 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the smart contract architecture incorporates a dynamic rarity scoring system that adjusts token rarity based on achievement novelty, data completeness, or participant engagement levels.

Claim 8 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein the system employs cryptographic proof revocation mechanisms to support user-initiated data erasure requests in compliance with GDPR and similar privacy regulations.

Claim 9 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, further comprising automated smart contract execution for revenue sharing among stakeholders—including health data providers, verification services, and content creators—based on achievement validation and marketplace transactions.

Claim 10 (Dependent):
The method of claim 1, wherein achievement validation involves cryptographic proof generation using zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs), tailored for health data verification circuits.

Claim 11 (System):
A blockchain-based health achievement token system comprising:  

a data ingestion module receiving verified health measurements from multiple trusted sources;
an AI-powered pattern recognition engine trained to detect and redact PHI;
a healthcare-standard encoder generating achievement metadata compliant with SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD standards;
a cryptographic commitment module supporting zero-knowledge proof creation;
a smart contract engine for minting ERC-721 tokens, managing royalties, and enforcing compliance features such as data erasure and cross-chain interoperability; and
an API for third-party verification that confirms achievement validity without access to raw health data.
Claim 12 (Dependent):
The system of claim 11, wherein the pattern recognition engine employs deep NLP trained specifically on healthcare regulatory language to detect PHI with high accuracy and low false positives.

Claim 13 (Dependent):
The system of claim 11, wherein the achievement metadata encoding supports compliance with GDPR, including consent management, data access, and right-to-erasure functionalities.

Claim 14 (Dependent):
The system of claim 11, wherein the cryptographic commitment module generates proofs that are compatible with zero-knowledge proof protocols, enabling third-party validation in a privacy-preserving manner.

Claim 15 (Dependent):
The system of claim 11, further comprising a cross-chain bridge connector supporting secure transfer and verification of health achievement NFTs across multiple blockchain networks.

Claim 16 (Dependent):
The system of claim 11, wherein the smart contract architecture includes an adaptive rarity scoring module that evaluates achievement uniqueness and participant engagement to adjust token rarity dynamically.                    Abstract
A blockchain-based system for transforming verified health data into tradeable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that adheres to HIPAA and GDPR regulations. The system automatically detects and sanitizes protected health information (PHI), generates compliant metadata describing health achievements, and mints ERC-721 tokens on blockchain networks. It supports secure, regulated marketplace trading through smart contracts with automated business associate agreements, dynamic rarity scoring, cross-chain compatibility, and compliance mechanisms such as time-locked verification and GDPR-compliant token burning, ensuring privacy and regulatory adherence while enabling health data monetization.
