DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0009] The following detailed description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. For purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature and embodiments are set forth to provide a thorough understanding. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. The descriptions of specific embodiments are provided for purpose of illustration and representation, not limitation.

Terminology and Definitions
To ensure clarity and to control the interpretation of the claims appended hereto, the following terms are defined as follows:

[0010] “Digital Health Attestation” refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject and comprises descriptive text. In various embodiments, such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, authenticated text streams from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, data streams from a verified wearable biometric sensor, or a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, confirming compliance with a set of health parameters.

[0011] “Protected Health Information (PHI)” is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service.

[0012] “Healthcare Ontology” refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10. The use of such an ontology enables semantic interoperability for the data processed by the system.

[0013] "Sanitized Descriptive Data" refers to the output generated by the AI-powered pattern recognition engine after it has programmatically transformed the descriptive text of a digital health attestation by identifying and redacting PHI while preserving the underlying semantic context.

[0014] "Structured Metadata Object" refers to a new digital data structure programmatically generated by the healthcare standards encoder. This object is created from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping a health-related fact therein to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. Critically, this object is created and stored in an off-chain environment.

[0015] “Non-Fungible Token (NFT)” refers to a unique cryptographic token residing on a blockchain. In the context of the present invention, an NFT serves as a verifiable and tradeable representation of a sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link pointing exclusively to its corresponding off-chain Structured Metadata Object.

System Architecture and Operation
[0016] A primary technical barrier preventing the tokenization of health data is the significant legal and privacy risk of immutably recording PHI on a public, distributed ledger. The present invention overcomes this barrier by providing a specific, non-obvious architectural solution that programmatically transforms health data into a verifiable and tradeable token without ever exposing PHI to the blockchain. The system is architected to perform a specific sequence of off-chain transformations prior to any on-chain transaction, thereby creating a new type of digital health asset that is verifiably compliant by design.

[0017] The system and its method of operation will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Description of the Drawings
[0018] Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrates the overall system architecture (100). The system comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110) configured to receive a digital health attestation; an AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) configured to programmatically transform descriptive text into sanitized descriptive data; a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) configured to programmatically generate a new, off-chain structured metadata object; and a Smart Contract Engine (140) configured to mint an NFT with an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain object.

[0019] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 1 Architecture: Consider a large-scale, post-market surveillance study for a new pharmaceutical drug. A pharmaceutical company needs to gather real-world evidence of drug efficacy and side effects from thousands of patients. Using the system (100), a patient can authorize the ingestion of their physician's notes (a digital health attestation). The system processes these notes, redacting all PHI, and creates a token representing, for example, "Patient experienced symptom X (SNOMED code: 12345) after taking drug Y." The pharmaceutical company can then purchase these verifiable, privacy-preserving tokens at scale, creating a dataset of unprecedented quality for their research and FDA reporting, while the patient is compensated for contributing their anonymized data. This solves a multi-billion dollar problem for drug development.

[0020] Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart illustrates the core data transformation process. The process begins with a Verified Health Attestation (210). It undergoes AI-Powered PHI Sanitization (220) to produce sanitized data. The data then undergoes Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding (230) to generate the new structured metadata object. A Cryptographic Commitment (240) (e.g., a hash) is generated, and the process culminates in NFT Minting (250) to create the Compliant Health NFT (260).

[0021] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 2 Data Transformation: A health insurance company wishes to offer personalized wellness incentives. A user connects their wearable fitness device, which generates a stream of data including workout notes ("Completed a strenuous 5k run today"). This stream is a Verified Health Attestation (210). The system processes this note via Sanitization (220) and Encoding (230) to create a structured object representing "Attestation of moderate-to-high cardiovascular activity." An NFT is minted (250). The user can submit this token to their insurer as verifiable proof of meeting a wellness goal, unlocking a premium discount. The insurer receives only the verified, relevant fact without accessing the user's full, sensitive health profile, thus maintaining privacy while reducing risk and operational overhead.
