: Final Patent Formatting and Compliance

You are to act as a technical editor performing a final formatting and compliance check on a provided U.S. non-provisional patent application. Your task is to correct specific formatting and numbering errors to ensure the document is perfectly compliant with USPTO standards for filing.

the document you are editing is sani engine patentmd in sani engine patent folder. 

Required Corrections:

1. Correct Section Heading Formatting:



Where: Throughout the entire document.

What to Fix: The provided text runs all sections together. Insert the standard, capitalized, and centered headings for each major section.

Why: Formal headings are required by the USPTO for clarity and proper document structure. The required headings, in order, are:BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (with sub-headings Field of the Invention and Description of Related Art)

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION (with a sub-heading Terminology and Definitions)

CLAIMS

ABSTRACT

2. Correct Specification Paragraph Numbering:



Where: At the end of the Detailed Description of the Invention section.

What to Fix: The paragraph numbering in the provided text is not perfectly consecutive. Find the last paragraph describing FIG. 4 ([0026]) and ensure the two boilerplate paragraphs that follow it are correctly and sequentially numbered as [0027] and [0028].

Why: USPTO regulations (37 CFR ยง 1.52) require that paragraph numbering be continuous throughout the specification.

3. Remove Paragraph Numbers from Claims:



Where: The CLAIMS section.

What to Fix: Remove all bracketed, four-digit paragraph numbers from the line "What is claimed is:" and from every numbered claim (1-20).

Why: The claims have their own independent numbering system (1, 2, 3, etc.) and must not contain the specification's paragraph numbers. This is a critical formatting requirement.

Final Output:

Please provide the complete, fully corrected text of the patent application as the final output, with all formatting and numbering issues resolved.
