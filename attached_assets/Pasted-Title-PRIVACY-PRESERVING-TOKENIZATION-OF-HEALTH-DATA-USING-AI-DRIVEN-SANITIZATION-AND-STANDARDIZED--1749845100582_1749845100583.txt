Title: PRIVACY-PRESERVING TOKENIZATION OF HEALTH DATA USING AI-DRIVEN SANITIZATION AND STANDARDIZED ONTOLOGIESInventor: Dr. Michael E Hollins JrAddress: 56 Beaver St., Apt. 205, New York, NY 10004 USACross-Reference to Related Applications: NoneBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention[0001] The present invention relates generally to the fields of digital data processing and cryptographic asset management. More particularly, the invention pertains to systems and methods that combine machine learning for privacy-preserving data sanitization with blockchain technology for creating verifiable and tradeable digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), within environments governed by regulatory compliance frameworks.Description of Related Art[0002] Current health data monetization systems suffer from privacy violations and regulatory compliance failures. Furthermore, the state of the art includes explorations into related technologies. For instance, academic frameworks like 'RedactOR' by Singh et al. teach methods for de-identifying text using Large Language Models while preserving semantic context. Concurrently, patents like U.S. Pat. No. 11,782,942 to Liang et al. teach methods for linking unstructured clinical notes to structured data resources.[0003] However, none of these references, alone or in combination, teach the specific, sequential process of the present invention. Specifically, the prior art does not disclose a method wherein the semantically preserved, sanitized text itself is used as the direct input for a programmatic data encoder to create a new layer of structured, ontology-mapped metadata, which is then made verifiable and tradeable via an NFT. This unique step of structuring the privacy-preserved output solves the critical problem of creating a data asset that is simultaneously safe for analysis, structurally queryable, and verifiably compliant.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION[0004] The present invention provides a system and method for generating a verifiable and tradeable health data token. In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises: receiving, at a hardware processor, a digital health attestation comprising descriptive text; programmatically transforming the descriptive text into sanitized data by using a machine learning model to redact protected health information (PHI); programmatically generating a new structured metadata object in an off-chain environment from the sanitized data by mapping a health-related fact to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology; and minting, by a smart contract engine, a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, wherein the NFT embeds an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain structured metadata object. In another embodiment, a system for performing this method is provided, comprising: a data ingestion module configured to receive the attestation; an AI-powered pattern recognition engine configured to programmatically transform the descriptive text; a healthcare standards encoder configured to programmatically generate the new, off-chain structured metadata object; and a smart contract engine configured to mint the NFT with the exclusive immutable link.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS[0005] FIG. 1: System Architecture is a block diagram illustrating the overall system architecture for generating a compliant health data token.[0006] FIG. 2: Data Transformation Flowchart is a flowchart illustrating the core data transformation process for converting a verified health attestation into a compliant non-fungible token (NFT).[0007] FIG. 3: Synergistic System Operation is a block diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of the system in synergistic operation with a dynamic zero-knowledge proof verification system.[0008] FIG. 4: NFT Metadata Structure is a diagram illustrating an exemplary data structure for the metadata associated with a compliant health data token.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION[0009] The following detailed description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. For purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature and embodiments are set forth to provide a thorough understanding. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. The descriptions of specific embodiments are provided for purpose of illustration and representation, not limitation.Terminology and DefinitionsTo ensure clarity and to control the interpretation of the claims appended hereto, the following terms are defined as follows:[0010] “Digital Health Attestation” refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject and comprises descriptive text. In various embodiments, such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, authenticated text streams from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, data streams from a verified wearable biometric sensor, or a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, confirming compliance with a set of health parameters.[0011] “Protected Health Information (PHI)” is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service.[0012] “Healthcare Ontology” refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10. The use of such an ontology enables semantic interoperability for the data processed by the system.[0013] "Sanitized Descriptive Data" refers to the output generated by the AI-powered pattern recognition engine after it has programmatically transformed the descriptive text of a digital health attestation by identifying and redacting PHI while preserving the underlying semantic context.[0014] "Structured Metadata Object" refers to a new digital data structure programmatically generated by the healthcare standards encoder. This object is created from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping a health-related fact therein to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. Critically, this object is created and stored in an off-chain environment.[0015] “Non-Fungible Token (NFT)” refers to a unique cryptographic token residing on a blockchain. In the context of the present invention, an NFT serves as a verifiable and tradeable representation of a sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link pointing exclusively to its corresponding off-chain Structured Metadata Object.System Architecture and Operation[0016] A primary technical barrier preventing the tokenization of health data is the significant legal and privacy risk of immutably recording PHI on a public, distributed ledger. The present invention overcomes this barrier by providing a specific, non-obvious architectural solution that programmatically transforms health data into a verifiable and tradeable token without ever exposing PHI to the blockchain. The system is architected to perform a specific sequence of off-chain transformations prior to any on-chain transaction, thereby creating a new type of digital health asset that is verifiably compliant by design.[0017] The system and its method of operation will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.Description of the Drawings[0018] Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrates the overall system architecture (100). The system comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110) configured to receive a digital health attestation; an AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) configured to programmatically transform descriptive text into sanitized descriptive data; a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) configured to programmatically generate a new, off-chain structured metadata object; and a Smart Contract Engine (140) configured to mint an NFT with an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain object.[0019] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 1 Architecture: Consider a large-scale, post-market surveillance study for a new pharmaceutical drug. A pharmaceutical company needs to gather real-world evidence of drug efficacy and side effects from thousands of patients. Using the system (100), a patient can authorize the ingestion of their physician's notes (a digital health attestation). The system processes these notes, redacting all PHI, and creates a token representing, for example, "Patient experienced symptom X (SNOMED code: 12345) after taking drug Y." The pharmaceutical company can then purchase these verifiable, privacy-preserving tokens at scale, creating a dataset of unprecedented quality for their research and FDA reporting, while the patient is compensated for contributing their anonymized data. This solves a multi-billion dollar problem for drug development.[0020] Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart illustrates the core data transformation process. The process begins with a Verified Health Attestation (210). It undergoes AI-Powered PHI Sanitization (220) to produce sanitized data. The data then undergoes Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding (230) to generate the new structured metadata object. A Cryptographic Commitment (240) (e.g., a hash) is generated, and the process culminates in NFT Minting (250) to create the Compliant Health NFT (260).[0021] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 2 Data Transformation: A health insurance company wishes to offer personalized wellness incentives. A user connects their wearable fitness device, which generates a stream of data including workout notes ("Completed a strenuous 5k run today"). This stream is a Verified Health Attestation (210). The system processes this note via Sanitization (220) and Encoding (230) to create a structured object representing "Attestation of moderate-to-high cardiovascular activity." An NFT is minted (250). The user can submit this token to their insurer as verifiable proof of meeting a wellness goal, unlocking a premium discount. The insurer receives only the verified, relevant fact without accessing the user's full, sensitive health profile, thus maintaining privacy while reducing risk and operational overhead.[0022] Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrates a preferred embodiment using a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). A Dynamic ZK Verification System (310) generates a Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320), which serves as the input to the NFTME System (330) (representing the overall system of the invention).[0023] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 3 Synergistic Operation: A government agency or airline requires proof of compliance with a health mandate (e.g., a specific vaccination) for travel. A user, not wishing to disclose their entire medical history, uses the ZK Verification System (310) to generate a proof (320) that cryptographically attests they meet the mandate's criteria without revealing any other information. This ZKP is the input to the NFTME System (330), which then creates a token representing "Holder has a valid travel health credential." The user can present this token to the agency, which can verify it on the blockchain, preserving the user's privacy completely.[0024] Referring to FIG. 4, a diagram illustrates an exemplary data structure for the metadata that can be associated with the NFT. The structure may comprise fields such as attestation_type (410), subject_attestation_hash (420), the immutable_link (430) to the full off-chain object, and a validation_method (440).[0025] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 4 Metadata Structure: A decentralized clinical trial platform wants to recruit participants who meet specific criteria. Researchers can programmatically scan the blockchain for tokens whose metadata contains specific values. For instance, a query could seek tokens where attestation_type (410) is 'Authenticated Lab Result' and the off-chain data (referenced by immutable_link (430)) contains a specific ontology code for a biomarker. This allows for highly efficient, privacy-preserving patient discovery, as researchers can identify qualifying anonymous tokens and then invite the token holders to participate.Exemplary Embodiments and Additional Features[0026] The Smart Contract Engine (140) can be configured with additional logic modules to enhance the functionality of the minted NFT. For instance, a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) Module may be included. This computer-implemented module programmatically calculates a numerical ADS by comparing the ontology-mapped structured metadata of the attestation against a historical database of previously processed attestations to determine statistical novelty, thereby providing a metric for the asset's potential value for research or analysis.[0027] In other embodiments, the smart contract may implement a time-locking mechanism, wherein the NFT is non-transferable until a specific on-chain or off-chain condition is met, verified via an oracle. Furthermore, the system may execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism, wherein a user-initiated data erasure request triggers an update to a public revocation list or a state change in the smart contract, thereby allowing verifiers to confirm that the immutable link within the NFT is no longer considered valid.CLAIMSWhat is claimed is:A computer-implemented method for generating a regulatory-compliant health data token, comprising:(a) receiving, at a hardware processor, a digital health attestation comprising descriptive text;(b) programmatically transforming, by a machine learning model, the descriptive text into sanitized descriptive data by identifying and redacting protected health information (PHI) while preserving semantic context;(c) programmatically generating a new structured metadata object from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping, via a healthcare standards encoder, a health-related fact from the sanitized descriptive data to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology, wherein the structured metadata object is created in an off-chain environment to ensure semantic interoperability without recording PHI on-chain; and(d) minting, by a smart contract engine, a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, said NFT embedding an immutable link pointing exclusively to the new structured metadata object.The method of claim 1, wherein the digital health attestation is a zero-knowledge proof whose validity constraints were dynamically adjusted based on environmental metadata.The method of claim 1, wherein the healthcare ontology is at least one of SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10.The method of claim 1, wherein the minting includes generating a time-locked NFT.The method of claim 1, further comprising a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) module configured to calculate an ADS for the NFT.The method of claim 1, further comprising enabling secure transfer of the NFT across multiple blockchain networks via a cross-chain bridge protocol.The method of claim 1, further comprising executing a cryptographic revocation mechanism in response to a user-initiated data erasure request.The method of claim 1, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to automatically execute revenue sharing distributions.The method of claim 1, wherein the digital health attestation is a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK).A system for generating a health data token, comprising:(a) a data ingestion module configured to receive a digital health attestation comprising descriptive text;(b) an AI-powered pattern recognition engine communicatively coupled to the data ingestion module, the engine comprising a machine learning model configured to programmatically transform the descriptive text into sanitized descriptive data by identifying and redacting protected health information (PHI) while preserving semantic context;(c) a healthcare standards encoder communicatively coupled to the engine and configured to programmatically generate a new structured metadata object from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping a health-related fact from the sanitized descriptive data to one or more healthcare ontology codes, wherein the structured metadata object is created in an off-chain environment to ensure semantic interoperability without recording PHI on-chain; and(d) a smart contract engine communicatively coupled to the encoder and configured to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, said NFT embedding an immutable link pointing exclusively to the new structured metadata object.The system of claim 10, wherein the digital health attestation is a zero-knowledge proof whose validity constraints were dynamically adjusted based on environmental metadata.The system of claim 10, wherein the healthcare standards encoder is configured to use at least one of SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10.The system of claim 10, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to generate a time-locked NFT.The system of claim 10, wherein the smart contract engine further comprises a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) module configured to calculate and store an ADS for the NFT.The system of claim 10, further comprising a cross-chain bridge connector configured to enable secure transfer of the NFT.The system of claim 10, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism.The system of claim 10, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to automatically execute revenue sharing distributions.The system of claim 10, further comprising a verification application programming interface (API) configured to receive a zero-knowledge proof and output a validation result.ABSTRACTA method and system for generating a regulatory-compliant health data token. A digital health attestation is received at a hardware processor. A machine learning model programmatically transforms descriptive text from the attestation into sanitized data by redacting protected health information (PHI) while preserving semantic context. In an off-chain environment, a new structured metadata object is programmatically generated from the sanitized data by mapping a health-related fact to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. A smart contract engine then mints a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, where the NFT embeds an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain structured metadata object. This specific architectural solution solves the technical problem of placing PHI on a blockchain while maintaining semantic interoperability, enabling the creation of verifiable and tradeable digital health assets.
