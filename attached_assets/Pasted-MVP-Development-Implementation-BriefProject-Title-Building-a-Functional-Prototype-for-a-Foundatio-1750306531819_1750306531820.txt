MVP Development & Implementation BriefProject Title: Building a Functional Prototype for a Foundational Verifiable Data ArchitectureObjective: To generate the necessary code to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that substantiates the core claims of three related patents: the ZKP Patent, the Sani-Engine Patent, and the Tokenization Patent. This document provides the specific instructions for an AI agent or development team to implement each component.Part 1: The ZKP Engine (Substantiating the ZKP Patent)Application Overview:Build a command-line or simple web application that demonstrates the dynamic generation of a Zero-Knowledge Proof based on contextual inputs. This will serve as a proof-of-concept for the "Privacy-Preserving Age Verification" use case.Technologies:Language: JavaScript (using Node.js).ZKP Framework: Circom (for writing the circuit) and SnarkJS (for generating and verifying the proof).Core Features to Implement:Rules Database Simulation:Create a simple JSON file named rules.json. This file will act as our machine-readable rules database.The JSON should contain a single rule: "age_requirement": 21.Dynamic Circuit Generation Logic:Write a script that receives two inputs: a user_date_of_birth (in YYYY-MM-DD format) and the current_date.The script must read the age_requirement from the rules.json file.It will then programmatically write a new Circom circuit file (e.g., age_check.circom). This circuit will define the mathematical problem: Is (current_date - user_date_of_birth) >= age_requirement?. This step is critical as it demonstrates the dynamic configuration of the circuit.Proof Generation:Use the SnarkJS library to compile the newly generated age_check.circom file.Execute the circuit with the user_date_of_birth and current_date as inputs.Generate a valid ZKP and a public proof file.Verification:Write a separate function that takes the generated proof and verifies it, outputting a simple true or false.Claims Substantiated: This implementation will provide a working model for the core method of your ZKP patent, specifically proving the claims related to using a rules database to dynamically configure a cryptographic circuit.Part 2: The Sani-Engine (Substantiating the Sani-Engine Patent)Application Overview:Build a Python script that demonstrates the synergistic, two-stage process of sanitizing an unstructured text document and then structuring it. This will use the legal e-discovery use case.Technologies:Language: PythonAI/NLP Libraries: spaCy or the Hugging Face Transformers library.Core Features to Implement:Input Document:Create a sample text file (sample_contract.txt) containing a few paragraphs of a mock legal contract. Include sensitive information like company names, executive names, and financial figures.Context-Aware Sanitization:Write a Python function that loads the sample_contract.txt.Use an NLP model (e.g., a pre-trained Named Entity Recognition model from spaCy) to identify entities tagged as "PERSON," "ORG" (organization), and "MONEY."Implement a "redaction" function that replaces these identified entities with generic placeholders (e.g., [EXECUTIVE NAME], [COMPANY], [FINANCIAL_FIGURE]) while leaving the rest of the sentence structure perfectly intact. This demonstrates context-preserving sanitization.Ontological Structuring:Write a second function that takes the sanitized text as its input.Using NLP techniques (like dependency parsing in spaCy), extract key relationships from the sanitized text. For example, identify the relationship between [COMPANY] and a "Governing Law" clause.Generate a structured JSON output that represents these relationships.Composite Data Object:The script's final output should be a single JSON object that contains two keys: "sanitized_text" (containing the full redacted document) and "structured_metadata" (containing the JSON from the previous step).Claims Substantiated: This code will directly substantiate the claims related to the synergistic sanitization/structuring process and the creation of the novel "Composite Data Object."Part 3: The "Smart Ticket" Smart Contract (Substantiating the Tokenization Patent)Application Overview:Write a complete, deployable smart contract in Solidity that implements the "Smart Ticket" NFT, including the advanced features for anti-scalping.Technologies:Language: SolidityFramework: Use the industry-standard OpenZeppelin Contracts library for security and best practices (specifically, their ERC721 and Ownable contracts).Core Features to Implement:Standard NFT Functionality:The contract must be a compliant ERC-721 token.Include a safeMint function that allows an authorized owner (the "artist") to mint a new ticket to a specific fan's wallet address.Programmable Rules (The "Anti-Scalping" Logic):Time-Lock: Implement logic that makes the NFT non-transferable until a specific unlockDate (e.g., 24 hours before the event) is reached. This substantiates your "time-locked NFT" claim.Price Cap: Implement logic so that if the ticket is sold on a secondary market, the price cannot exceed a certain percentage of the faceValue stored in the contract.Revenue Sharing: Implement a function that, upon a secondary sale, automatically splits the proceeds, sending a defined percentage back to the artist_wallet. This substantiates your "revenue sharing distributions" claim.Claims Substantiated: This smart contract will be a working, deployable version of the programmable digital asset you've patented, proving that the novel anti-scalping features are technically feasible.Final Instructions:Please generate the complete, well-commented code for each of these three components. This MVP will serve as a powerful "reduction to practice" for the entire patent portfolio.
