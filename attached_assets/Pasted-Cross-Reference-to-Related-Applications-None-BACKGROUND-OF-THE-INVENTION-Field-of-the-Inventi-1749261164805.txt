BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

[0001] This invention relates to computer-implemented methods for health data verification, specifically cryptographic proof systems that enable verification of health data and medical compliance criteria without exposing sensitive personal health information.

Description of the Related Art

[0002] It is an object of the present invention to provide a privacy-preserving method for verifying biometric data compliance without disclosing underlying health information; to replace trust-based reporting systems with cryptographic verification mechanisms; to enable scalable third-party health data validation using zero-knowledge proofs; to reduce fraud in wellness programs, insurance claims, and public health initiatives; and to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks including HIPAA, GDPR, and emerging international privacy laws.

[0003] Current health data verification systems—including self-reporting mobile applications, centralized electronic health records (EHR), and third-party reporting—require transmission and inspection of raw biometric data such as heart rate, sleep metrics, and activity levels. This exposes sensitive personal data and creates major privacy, regulatory, and security risks. Most systems rely on manual validation, trusted intermediaries, or centralized data collection, all of which are vulnerable to fraud, incompatible with modern privacy regulations, and unsuitable for large-scale deployment scenarios.

[0004] Furthermore, existing systems lack cryptographic assurances of data integrity and compliance. Studies show that self-reported health data introduces fraud rates exceeding 20%, especially in wellness incentive programs. Manual methods are slow, expensive, and fail to meet auditability and data minimization mandates under GDPR Article 5 and HIPAA's minimum necessary provisions.

[0005] No existing framework offers a cryptographically verifiable method for asserting that biometric data meets compliance requirements—such as physiological thresholds, temporal behaviors, or geographic exposure criteria—while preserving privacy, preventing data tampering, and enabling scalable third-party validation. This invention solves these deficiencies by introducing a zero-knowledge proof system specifically tailored for health data validation, built on constraint satisfaction circuits that validate biometric data without disclosure.

[0006] The system architecture supports deployment across mobile, cloud, wearable, and edge devices, including disconnected or resource-constrained environments such as military operations, remote field medicine, orbital platforms, and employer wellness programs. It includes real-time constraint adaptation based on biometric trends, environmental metadata (e.g., altitude, climate, GPS), and automatic selection of regulatory frameworks based on IP location or user profile. Privacy enforcement features include user consent capture, audit trail logging, and data deletion in compliance with GDPR and HIPAA requirements.

[0007] Prior systems have explored zero-knowledge techniques for data validation and identity management: US20150066867A1 introduces a method for zero-knowledge attestation validation, enabling the verification of statements between primary and authority accounts without revealing their identities. This system employs a multi-key mechanism to facilitate anonymous validation across separate databases. US20220200975A1 details a method for zero-knowledge private key management within decentralized applications. It focuses on creating identity smart contracts and managing validators to authenticate users without exposing private keys, enhancing identity verification on blockchain networks.

[0008] While these inventions contribute to privacy-preserving data validation and identity management, they do not address the specific challenges associated with health data verification. Notably, they lack mechanisms for: dynamic adjustment of constraint parameters based on environmental factors such as altitude, temperature, and circadian rhythms; jurisdiction-aware compliance that automatically aligns with regional health regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) using geolocation metadata; operation in resource-constrained or disconnected environments, such as military deployments or remote medical facilities, where real-time connectivity is limited; and integration with health-specific data sources and the ability to generate zero-knowledge proofs that validate physiological and temporal health constraints without exposing raw biometric data.

[0009] The present invention addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive system that: aggregates health data from various sources (e.g., wearables, mobile health apps) and performs local validation and cleaning; implements a zero-knowledge proof generation engine tailored for health data, incorporating biological plausibility constraints and temporal validation circuits; utilizes a blockchain storage layer for immutable proof anchoring, supporting various integration approaches including Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 solutions; and provides a verification API framework that supports multiple workflow patterns and ensures compliance with privacy regulations. By addressing the unique requirements of health data verification, this invention offers a novel solution that enhances privacy, compliance, and operational efficiency beyond the capabilities of existing systems.
