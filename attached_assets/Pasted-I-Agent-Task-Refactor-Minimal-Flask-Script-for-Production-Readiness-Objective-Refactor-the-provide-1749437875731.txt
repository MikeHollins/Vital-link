I Agent Task: Refactor Minimal Flask Script for Production Readiness
Objective: Refactor the provided Python Flask script to align with modern best practices. The goals are to improve security, make the configuration more flexible, and prepare the structure for future scalability.

File to Refactor: app.py

Change 1: Separate Application Logic from Server Execution
Where: The if __name__ == '__main__': block.
What to Change: Remove the app.run() call entirely. The Python script should only define the app object and its routes. The web server should be managed by a dedicated production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn.
Why: The built-in Flask development server (app.run()) is not secure, stable, or performant enough for a production environment. Separating the application from the server is a fundamental best practice. The application should be run with a command like gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 4 app:app.
Change 2: Implement Environment-Based Configuration
Where: At the top of the script.
What to Change: Instead of hardcoding the host and port, read these values from environment variables using Python's os module. Provide sensible defaults if the variables are not set.
Why: This makes the application portable. The same code can be run in development, testing, and production environments with different configurations without needing any code changes, which is a critical practice for modern software deployment.
Change 3: Return Structured JSON Responses
Where: The hello_world route function.
What to Change: Modify the function to return a JSON object using Flask's jsonify utility instead of a plain text string.
Why: Modern web APIs almost always communicate using JSON. It provides a structured data format that is easily parsed by clients (like a web frontend or another service). Returning structured data is more scalable and robust than returning plain text.
Final Implementation Code:
Your final output must be the following refactored app.py file, which incorporates all the recommended best practices.

Python

import os
from flask import Flask, jsonify

# Create the Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
  """
  A simple health check endpoint that returns a structured JSON response.
  """
  # Best Practice: Return JSON objects for API endpoints
  response = {
    "message": "Hello, World!",
    "status": "ok"
  }
  return jsonify(response)

# Note: The 'if __name__ == "__main__"' block is removed.
# The application should be started with a production WSGI server.
# Example command using Gunicorn:
# gunicorn --bind ${HOST}:${PORT} --workers 4 app:app
#
# To run in development with Flask's built-in server, you can use the command:
# FLASK_APP=app flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
