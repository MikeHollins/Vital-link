[0049] Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–150), the system architecture is shown in the context of a global pandemic response, where verifiable, privacy-preserving health credentials are required for international travel and access to public venues. The Data Ingestion Module (110) receives a verified health attestation, such as a digitally signed vaccination record. The AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) and Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) process the attestation to create a sanitized, interoperable credential. The Smart Contract Engine (140) mints this credential as a secure non-fungible token (NFT). Finally, the Verification API (150) allows an authorized entity to cryptographically verify the NFT's authenticity without accessing personal health records.

[0050] Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–260), the core data transformation flowchart is illustrated using a use case for long-term health state verification. The process begins when a Verified Health Attestation (210) is received. The attestation is processed through the AI-Powered PHI Sanitization step (220) to redact personal identifiers. During the Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding step (230), the health state is mapped to a standard code. After a Cryptographic Commitment (240) is generated, the NFT Minting step (250) creates a Compliant Health NFT (260), which serves as a durable, verifiable digital record of compliance.

[0051] Referring to FIG. 3 (Components 300–330), the synergistic operation is detailed within the context of generating a high-integrity health attestation. A Dynamic ZK Verification System (310) first generates a Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320). This high-fidelity proof is then received as the primary input by the NFTME System (330), ensuring the resulting tokenized attestation is based on data that is cryptographically verified as plausible under specific real-world conditions.

[0052] Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–440), the data structure of the NFT's metadata is shown. The metadata comprises several key fields, including an attestation_type field (410) containing a standardized ontology code, a subject_attestation_hash field (420) storing a cryptographic hash of the sanitized data, an immutable_link field (430) containing a URI to the full metadata file, and a validation_method field (440) specifying the proof type used.

[0053] The AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) may be implemented using a transformer-based machine learning model, such as a BERT variant, that has been specifically fine-tuned for this domain. The model is trained on a large corpus of diverse healthcare data, including clinical notes and HIPAA regulatory texts. This training allows the engine to perform named entity recognition (NER) with high accuracy, identifying and redacting specific categories of Protected Health Information (PHI) while preserving the contextual meaning of the underlying health attestation.

[0054] The Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) operates using a set of programmable mapping rules and a knowledge base of healthcare ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10). When it receives sanitized data, it parses the data for keywords, values, and context. For instance, a sanitized attestation confirming a blood pressure reading of "120/80 mmHg" is programmatically mapped to the corresponding SNOMED CT code for "Normotensive," generating structured, interoperable metadata.

[0055] The combination of AI-powered PHI sanitization, healthcare ontology encoding, and cryptographic proof generation produces several technical advantages. It creates a new type of digital asset that is simultaneously cryptographically verifiable, semantically interoperable, and safe for public commerce. This synergy solves a long-felt but unsolved need for a trustworthy and liquid market for verified health attestations, creating a high-integrity digital credential that was not previously possible.
