Of course. Here is the complete and final CLAIMS section, fully renumbered from 1 to 21, with the new "picture claim" inserted at position 3 and all subsequent dependencies corrected.

This block incorporates all of the strategic edits we have discussed. You can now replace the old claims section in your document with this complete version.

Final and Complete Claims Section (With All Updates)
What is claimed is:

A computer-implemented method for privacy-preserving verification of health data, comprising:
(a) receiving, at a hardware processor, biometric data from a sensor and associated environmental metadata;
(b) selecting, by the hardware processor, a set of physiological constraint parameters from a data store based on said environmental metadata;
(c) generating, by the hardware processor, a zero-knowledge proof from the biometric data using a cryptographic circuit defined by the selected set of physiological constraint parameters, wherein the proof verifies that the biometric data satisfies the constraints without revealing the biometric data;
(d) anchoring a hash of the zero-knowledge proof to a blockchain ledger to create an immutable and tamper-evident entry; and
(e) providing, via a verification interface, third-party access to the anchored proof hash for verification.

The method of claim 1, wherein the environmental metadata comprises at least one of altitude, climate, or geographic location, and wherein the selected physiological constraint parameters are adjusted based on said metadata.

The method of claim 2, wherein the environmental metadata is an altitude measurement and the biometric data is an oxygen saturation measurement, and wherein the set of physiological constraint parameters is selected to define an acceptable oxygen saturation range that is lower at a higher altitude than at a lower altitude.

The method of claim 1, wherein the zero-knowledge proof is generated using a sparse constraint model having a constraint matrix with a number of non-zero elements below a predetermined threshold to reduce computational overhead in resource-constrained environments, and comprises a zk-SNARK, Bulletproof, or quantum-resistant proof scheme.

The method of claim 1, wherein the constraint logic includes circadian rhythm validation based on user-specific chronotype and geographic time zone.

The method of claim 1, wherein the proof includes temporal sequencing to enforce chronological integrity and prevent replay attacks using cryptographic time-locking.

The method of claim 6, wherein the proof is anchored to a blockchain using smart contracts that timestamp the proof and automate verification.

The method of claim 1, wherein the zero-knowledge proof is generated using quantum-resistant cryptography, including lattice-based or hash-based proof constructions.

The method of claim 1, wherein user consent is managed through a lifecycle system that logs grant, revocation, and scope changes to an immutable audit record.

The method of claim 1, wherein the verification interface comprises a smart contract or secure API configured to validate the proof without accessing the biometric data.

A system for privacy-preserving verification of biometric data, comprising:
(a) a data intake module configured to receive biometric input from a sensor and associated environmental metadata;
(b) a constraint validation module communicatively coupled to the data intake module and configured to select a set of physiological constraint parameters from a memory based on the received environmental metadata;
(c) a zero-knowledge proof engine communicatively coupled to the constraint validation module and configured to generate a proof from the biometric input using a cryptographic circuit defined by the selected set of physiological constraint parameters, wherein the proof verifies compliance without revealing the biometric input;
(d) a blockchain anchoring module configured to record a hash of the proof on a distributed ledger; and
(e) a verification interface comprising a smart contract or secure API configured to enable third-party validation by comparing a submitted proof to the recorded proof hash.

The system of claim 11, wherein the environmental metadata comprises at least one of altitude, climate, or geographic location, and wherein the selected physiological constraint parameters are adjusted based on said metadata.

The system of claim 11, wherein the constraint validation module further comprises a circadian rhythm analysis module configured to validate the biometric data based on biometric time series data.

The system of claim 11, wherein the operation of the constraint validation module and proof engine results in data minimization and scope limitation by generating a proof without retaining or transmitting the raw biometric inputs.

The system of claim 11, wherein the constraint validation module and zero-knowledge proof engine operate within a trusted execution environment to isolate sensitive operations from the host system.

The system of claim 11, further comprising a privacy and consent management framework that implements timestamped authorization capture, audit trail generation with immutable ledger storage, and automated data deletion compliance with GDPR and HIPAA requirements.

The system of claim 11, wherein the zero-knowledge proof engine is configured for execution on resource-constrained platforms including mobile devices, edge nodes, or wearable sensors, by utilizing a sparse constraint model having a constraint matrix with a number of non-zero elements below a predetermined threshold.

The system of claim 11, wherein the blockchain anchoring module maintains an immutable audit trail with version tracking of proof submissions.

The system of claim 11, wherein the zero-knowledge proof engine is further configured to receive multiple zero-knowledge proofs as inputs and generate a single, valid aggregated proof, enabling aggregation across distributed or federated data sources.

The system of claim 11, wherein the verification interface is further configured to receive a request for a specific data attribute and, in response, validate a proof that attests only to said specific data attribute.

The system of claim 11, wherein the constraint validation module selects the set of physiological constraint parameters based on jurisdiction-specific rules linked to geographic metadata in a policy configuration profile.
