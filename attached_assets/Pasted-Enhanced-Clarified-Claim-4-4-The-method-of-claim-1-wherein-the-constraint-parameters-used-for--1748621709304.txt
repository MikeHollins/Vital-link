Enhanced & Clarified Claim 4

	4.	The method of claim 1, wherein the constraint parameters used for health data verification are dynamically reparameterized based on contextual and personalized inputs, comprising:

(i) user demographic data, including but not limited to age, sex, ethnicity, and known genetic predispositions;
(ii) medical history, including records of chronic conditions, medication regimens, clinical diagnoses, or historical biometric baselines;
(iii) environmental context, including real-time sensor inputs or metadata indicating air quality index (AQI), altitude, barometric pressure, humidity, ambient temperature, or time-zone-induced circadian disruption;

wherein constraint adjustment is performed using one or more machine learning models trained on physiologically labeled datasets, the models being configured to perform real-time constraint calibration under deployment conditions.

The method further comprises:

(a) automatically identifying applicable jurisdictional compliance frameworks using one or more of: IP address geolocation, GPS-derived coordinates, Wi-Fi SSID fingerprinting, or explicit user-configured regulatory settings;
(b) loading and applying regional constraint templates in accordance with relevant privacy laws or medical governance frameworks, including but not limited to: HIPAA (United States), GDPR (European Union), PIPEDA (Canada), and PDPA (Singapore);
(c) generating and storing cryptographically verifiable audit trails for all proof-generation events, wherein each event is associated with a unique signature, timestamp, and verifier endpoint identifier;
(d) capturing and linking user consent metadata to corresponding constraint evaluation and zero-knowledge proof generation steps, ensuring lawful processing under applicable legal mandates;
(e) enabling user-triggered data deletion or erasure, in accordance with privacy regulations including GDPR Article 17 (“right to be forgotten”) and HIPAA right-of-access and data minimization rules.
