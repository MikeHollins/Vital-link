The zero-knowledge health verification system comprises four core components, each designed to ensure secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable validation of personal health data:

1. Health Data Aggregation Module:
This component interfaces with multiple health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, etc.) to securely collect user health data. Data is validated and cleansed locally on the user's device, minimizing transmission risks. By maintaining data locally and transmitting only cryptographic commitments, the system ensures user privacy and reduces exposure to data breaches.

2. Cryptographic Proof Generator:
Leveraging custom-designed zk-SNARK circuits optimized for health data validation, this module enforces biological plausibility, temporal consistency, and demographic adjustments. It processes private inputs—such as daily step counts (0–100,000), timestamps, and encrypted user secrets—and generates succinct mathematical proofs of compliance with predefined health criteria (e.g., minimum 8,000 steps/day over 30 days). The circuit design incorporates specialized constraints to guarantee that all data entries meet physiological limits (0–50,000 baseline steps, 50,001–100,000 athletic steps), verify chronological order to prevent stale or replayed data, and cryptographically verify user identities via ECDSA P-256 signatures, ensuring authenticity without disclosing identities.

3. Blockchain Storage Layer:
This component stores the generated cryptographic proofs in an immutable distributed ledger, enabling transparent and publicly verifiable attestations. By storing only proofs and commitments, it prevents sensitive health data exposure while maintaining an auditable trail to support regulatory compliance. Smart contracts enforce proof validity and facilitate cross-jurisdictional verification workflows.

4. Verification API Framework:
Providing standardized interfaces, this framework supports third-party verification for insurance, employment, and research purposes. It preserves zero-knowledge properties, ensuring that verifiers confirm compliance without accessing raw data. The API enforces strict security protocols, including configurable time windows and anti-replay measures, such as timestamp validation, to prevent injection of stale or malicious data.

Technical Innovations and Performance:
The system employs custom constraint circuits tailored for health data, integrating public inputs (e.g., data criteria, time periods, user commitments) and private inputs (e.g., daily measurements, encrypted secrets). Its design ensures 99.7% accuracy in compliance verification, with proof generation times of 50–200ms per verification, proof sizes of 192–256 bytes using the Groth16 protocol, and verification times under 5ms. On standard cloud infrastructure (4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM), the system supports over 10,000 concurrent verifications per second, demonstrating its scalability and suitability for real-time health data attestations.
