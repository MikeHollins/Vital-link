Draft of Detailed Description of the Drawings
[0049] Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–150), the overall system architecture for generating a compliant health data token is shown. The architecture comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110) configured to receive a verified health attestation. The attestation is then passed to an AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120), which is communicatively coupled to the ingestion module. The engine processes the attestation and outputs sanitized data to a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130). The encoder, in turn, generates structured metadata and provides it to a Smart Contract Engine (140), which is configured to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain. Finally, a Verification Application Programming Interface (API) Framework (150) provides a secure endpoint for third parties to interact with the minted NFT.

[0050] Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–260), the core data transformation flowchart is illustrated using the use case of a diabetic user. The process begins when a Verified Health Attestation (210) is received, confirming the user has maintained an average blood glucose level below 140 mg/dL for 30 days. The attestation is processed through an AI-Powered PHI Sanitization step (220), where any potentially identifying information in the descriptive text is redacted. Next, during the Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding step (230), the achievement is mapped to a specific LOINC code representing "long-term blood glucose control." A Cryptographic Commitment Generation step (240) creates a secure hash of the sanitized data. Finally, during the NFT Minting step (250), a smart contract is executed to create the final Compliant Health NFT (260), which embeds an immutable link to the generated metadata and cryptographic commitment.

[0051] Referring to FIG. 3 (Components 300–330), the synergistic operation of the invention in its preferred embodiment is shown. A Dynamic ZK Verification System (310), as described in the co-pending ZKPatent application, first generates a high-trust Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320). This proof, which has been verified against constraints dynamically adjusted for environmental factors, is then received as the primary input by the NFTME System (330). This illustrates how the present invention is specifically configured to leverage the output of the verification system, using its cryptographically secure attestation as the "verified" input for the tokenization pipeline, thereby creating a final digital asset with the highest possible degree of trust and verifiability.

[0052] Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–440), the data structure of the compliant NFT's metadata is shown, using the example of a user who has completed a marathon. The metadata, stored as a JSON object on a decentralized storage system and linked to the NFT, comprises several key fields. An achievement_code field (410) contains the specific ontology code, such as a SNOMED CT code for "marathon completion." An attestation_hash field (420) stores the cryptographic hash of the sanitized attestation data, ensuring integrity. An immutable_link field (430) contains a URI (e.g., an IPFS hash) pointing to the full metadata object. Finally, a rarity_score field (440) may be included, containing a numerical score calculated by the smart contract engine based on the achievement's uniqueness.
