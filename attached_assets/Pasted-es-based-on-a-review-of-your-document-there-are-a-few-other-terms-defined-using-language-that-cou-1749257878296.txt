es — based on a review of your document, there are a few other terms defined using language that could be made clearer, broader, and more USPTO-friendly by adopting the same inclusive pattern used for “biometric or health-related data.”

Here are the main ones worth updating:

🔁 1. “Verifier”
Current (in context):

"A verifier may refer to a party, system, or entity authorized to confirm a health proof..."

🔧 Suggested improvement:

"Verifier," as used herein, includes but is not limited to individuals, systems, smart contracts, or organizations authorized to evaluate a zero-knowledge proof and confirm compliance with predefined constraints.

✅ Why: This clarifies decentralized (e.g., smart contract) and human-based verifiers alike, without limiting scope.

🔁 2. “Constraint logic”
Current (appears throughout but informally):
No formal definition currently appears.

🔧 Suggested definition:

"Constraint logic" includes, but is not limited to, rules, parameters, or validation models that determine whether biometric or health data satisfies physiological, temporal, contextual, or regulatory criteria.

✅ Why: Prevents a narrow reading that excludes AI-based validation, regulatory rulesets, or time-series inference models.

🔁 3. “Zero-knowledge proof”
Current (defined only contextually):

"Zero-knowledge proofs allow for verification of compliance without disclosure of raw data."

🔧 Suggested enhancement:

"Zero-knowledge proof" includes any cryptographic method that enables one party to prove possession of information satisfying specific conditions without revealing the information itself, including zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, and quantum-resistant variants.

✅ Why: This strengthens §112 support for claims involving specific proof schemes (e.g., Claim 3, Claim 7) while retaining broad scope.

🔁 4. “Consent lifecycle” or “consent”
Current (described, not defined):

"Consent logs may be used..."

🔧 Suggested addition:

"Consent" refers to user authorization for data processing, and may include grant, revocation, scoping, expiration, or jurisdiction-specific constraints. The 'consent lifecycle' includes all recorded changes to these authorizations, whether triggered by user action, verifier policy, or regulatory requirement.

✅ Why: Avoids ambiguity in Claim 8 and Claim 15 and supports enforceability under HIPAA/GDPR language.
