ZKP Circuit Construction for Health Data Constraints

To support privacy-preserving validation of health metrics, the system constructs zero-knowledge proof circuits using a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) model, which transforms each physiological validation rule into a series of arithmetic constraints over a finite field. For example, a heart rate plausibility constraint for an adult user can be encoded as a bounded range (HR_min â‰¤ HR â‰¤ HR_max), where HR is a private input derived from the biometric aggregation module. This is expressed in R1CS form as:

(HR - HR_min) * (HR_max - HR) = z

where z is a non-negative slack variable proving the heart rate lies within bounds without disclosing HR. If z = 0, the constraint passes; otherwise, it fails and halts circuit completion. These constraint templates are parameterized using user demographic metadata (e.g., age, gender, fitness level) and environmental inputs (e.g., altitude-adjusted HR_max), as captured by the environmental metadata integration layer.

ðŸ“Œ [0029B] Dynamic Circuit Compilation and Protocol Optimization

Each time the constraint validation module evaluates a biometric stream, a corresponding circuit is dynamically compiled into a zero-knowledge proof-compatible format (e.g., Groth16 for R1CS or AIR-compatible circuits for STARK-based systems). Public inputs to the circuit include regulatory thresholds (e.g., 21 CFR compliance rules), consent proof hashes, and timestamp verifiers. Private inputs include signed biometric samples, environmental calibration parameters, and derived constraint thresholds. The circuit compiler selects a proving systemâ€”such as zk-SNARKs for compactness or zk-STARKs for quantum resistanceâ€”based on hardware metrics retrieved from the performance monitor (e.g., GPU/ASIC load), and feeds these into the proof generation engine for trusted execution. The resulting proof is a succinct cryptographic attestation that all constraint rules were satisfied, which is then blockchain-anchored for auditability.
