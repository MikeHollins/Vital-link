SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0010] The present invention provides a system and method for privacy-preserving verification of biometric health data using zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs. The system enables third parties to confirm whether submitted biometric inputs meet physiological, temporal, and jurisdiction-specific constraints without disclosing the underlying health data.

[0011] In one embodiment, biometric data is collected from diverse sources including wearable devices, mobile health applications, environmental sensors, and electronic health records. A constraint validation module evaluates the data using logic circuits that enforce biological plausibility, temporal consistency, and regulatory compliance. Environmental metadata—such as altitude, climate, and location—is used to dynamically adapt constraint parameters.

[0012] The validated data is processed by a zero-knowledge proof engine operating within a trusted execution environment. This engine generates cryptographic proofs of constraint compliance using zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, or quantum-resistant constructions, without revealing private biometric values. The proof generation pipeline is optimized for mobile, edge, and federated deployments.

[0013] The resulting proof is anchored immutably to a blockchain ledger. Anchoring strategies include Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2 scalability solutions, or hybrid models leveraging decentralized storage. Each anchoring includes timestamping, audit trail maintenance, version tracking, and linkage to consent records.

[0014] A verifier interface enables secure third-party validation of the proofs via smart contracts, APIs, or automated workflows. The system supports selective disclosure, jurisdiction-aware filtering, and high-throughput verification. Consent lifecycle management and privacy-by-design enforcement are embedded throughout.

[0015] The invention provides a scalable, cryptographically verifiable mechanism for asserting health data compliance while preserving user privacy. It enhances auditability, reduces fraud, and supports legal compliance across medical, insurance, regulatory, and public health domains.
