Claim 16 (Revised – Full Version)

16. The system of claim 10, wherein the constraint validation module is configured to dynamically adjust constraint parameters based on:

(i) user-specific demographic and clinical data, including but not limited to:
	•	age,
	•	sex,
	•	chronic medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes),
	•	medication interactions (e.g., beta-blockers, stimulants), and
	•	personalized biometric trends derived from longitudinal health data;

(ii) temporal and environmental metadata, including:
	•	circadian phase shifts based on time zone or sleep-wake history,
	•	high-altitude compensation thresholds (e.g., adjusted oxygen saturation limits),
	•	local air quality index (AQI),
	•	relative humidity,
	•	and ambient temperature; and

(iii) learned biometric patterns identified from prior sensor data using machine learning models trained on time-series biometric sequences, said models configured to infer anomaly boundaries and suggest adaptive constraint reparameterization;

The system further comprises:

(a) a jurisdiction-aware compliance engine configured to determine applicable privacy and health regulation frameworks using:
	•	GPS coordinates,
	•	IP address lookup,
	•	Wi-Fi SSID fingerprinting,
	•	or explicit user preference declarations;

(b) a policy selector configured to retrieve and apply compliance profiles aligned with jurisdictional rules, including but not limited to:
	•	HIPAA (United States),
	•	GDPR (European Union),
	•	PDPA (Singapore),
	•	and PIPEDA (Canada);

(c) an audit subsystem configured to cryptographically log:
	•	all constraint evaluation and proof-generation activities,
	•	timestamped user consent events,
	•	and proof identifiers in a tamper-evident format; and

(d) a consent manager interface configured to:
	•	capture, verify, and revoke user consent for data processing in real-time,
	•	and enforce data erasure policies aligned with GDPR Article 17 and HIPAA right-of-access provisions, including secure deletion from local, cloud, or third-party systems upon request.
