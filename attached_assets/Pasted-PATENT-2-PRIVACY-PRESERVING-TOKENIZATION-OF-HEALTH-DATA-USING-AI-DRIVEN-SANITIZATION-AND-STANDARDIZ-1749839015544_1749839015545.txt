BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates generally to the fields of digital data processing and cryptographic asset management. More particularly, the invention pertains to systems and methods that combine machine learning for privacy-preserving data sanitization with blockchain technology for creating verifiable and tradeable digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), within environments governed by regulatory compliance frameworks.

Description of Related Art
[0002] Current health data monetization systems suffer from privacy violations and regulatory compliance failures. Furthermore, the state of the art includes explorations into related technologies. For instance, academic frameworks like 'RedactOR' by Singh et al. teach methods for de-identifying text using Large Language Models while preserving semantic context. Concurrently, patents like U.S. Pat. No. 11,782,942 to Liang et al. teach methods for linking unstructured clinical notes to structured data resources.

[0003] However, none of these references, alone or in combination, teach the specific, sequential process of the present invention. Specifically, the prior art does not disclose a method wherein the semantically preserved, sanitized text itself is used as the direct input for a programmatic data encoder to create a new layer of structured, ontology-mapped metadata, which is then made verifiable and tradeable via an NFT. This unique step of structuring the privacy-preserved output solves the critical problem of creating a data asset that is simultaneously safe for analysis, structurally queryable, and verifiably compliant.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004] The present invention provides a system and method for generating a privacy-preserving, regulatory-compliant digital health asset by converting a verified health attestation into a tokenized, blockchain-based representation. In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises receiving a digital health attestation, processing it with a machine learning model to redact protected health information (PHI) while preserving semantic context, generating structured metadata by mapping the sanitized data to a healthcare ontology, and minting a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain that embeds an immutable link to the structured metadata. In another embodiment, a system for performing this method is provided, comprising a data ingestion module, an AI-powered pattern recognition engine, a healthcare standards encoder, and a smart contract engine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0009] The following detailed description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. For purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature and embodiments are set forth to provide a thorough understanding. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. The descriptions of specific embodiments are provided for purpose of illustration and representation, not limitation.

Terminology and Definitions
[0010] "Digital Health Attestation" refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject. Such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, data streams from a verified biometric sensor, or a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, confirming compliance with a set of health parameters.

[0011] "Protected Health Information (PHI)" is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service.

[0012] "Healthcare Ontology" refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10.

[0013] "Non-Fungible Token (NFT)" refers to a unique cryptographic token residing on a blockchain that represents ownership or authenticity of a unique digital asset. In the context of the present invention, an NFT serves as a verifiable, tradeable digital asset representing a sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link to its corresponding structured metadata.

[0014] "Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) Module" refers to a computer-implemented module configured to programmatically calculate a numerical score representing the statistical novelty of a given health attestation. The calculation is performed by comparing the ontology-mapped structured metadata of the attestation against a historical database of previously processed attestations.

Description of the Drawings
[0015] Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–150), the system architecture is shown. A Data Ingestion Module (110) receives a verified health attestation. An AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) and a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) process the attestation. A Smart Contract Engine (140) mints a secure NFT. A Verification API (150) allows for authenticity verification.

[0016] It is a critical aspect of the present invention that it solves a long-felt but unsolved need at the intersection of blockchain technology and healthcare regulation. A primary technical barrier preventing the tokenization of health data is the significant legal risk of immutably recording PHI to a public blockchain. The present invention provides a specific, non-obvious architectural solution to this problem. By processing the health attestation through an AI-powered sanitization engine and a healthcare standards encoder prior to any blockchain interaction, and then minting an NFT that contains only an immutable link to the resulting off-chain, sanitized and structured metadata, the system ensures that no PHI is ever placed on the blockchain.

[0017] Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–260), the data transformation flowchart begins with a Verified Health Attestation (210), proceeds through AI-Powered PHI Sanitization (220) and Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding (230), generates a Cryptographic Commitment (240), and completes with NFT Minting (250) to create a Compliant Health NFT (260).

[0018] Referring to FIG. 3 (Components 300–330), a Dynamic ZK Verification System (310) generates a Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320), which is then received as the primary input by the NFTME System (330).

[0019] Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–440), the NFT's metadata structure is shown, comprising an attestation_type field (410), a subject_attestation_hash field (420), an immutable_link field (430), and a validation_method field (440).

[0020] In certain embodiments, the Smart Contract Engine (140) is configured with additional logic modules to enhance the functionality of the minted NFT. For instance, a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) module may be included, which programmatically calculates an ADS by comparing the NFT's ontology-mapped metadata against a historical database of previously minted attestations to determine statistical novelty. The smart contract may also implement a time-locking mechanism, wherein the NFT is non-transferable until a specific on-chain or off-chain condition is met, verified via an oracle. Furthermore, the system may execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism, wherein a user-initiated data erasure request triggers an update to a public revocation list, thereby allowing verifiers to confirm that the immutable link within the NFT is no longer considered valid.

[0021] The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto.

[0022] It is to be understood that the systems and methods described herein may be implemented on one or more computing devices. Such a device will typically include at least one hardware processor and a memory storing instructions, which, when executed, cause the device to perform the steps of the methods described herein.

ABSTRACT
A method and system for generating a health data token. The process comprises receiving a digital health attestation. A machine learning model processes the attestation to redact protected health information (PHI). A healthcare standards encoder then generates structured metadata by mapping a health-related fact to a healthcare ontology code. Finally, a smart contract engine mints a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, with the NFT embedding an immutable link to the structured metadata. This process enables the creation of trustworthy, regulatory-compliant digital health assets.
