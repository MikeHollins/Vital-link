Improvement Over Prior Art


Prior systems have explored zero-knowledge techniques for data validation and identity management:

US20150066867A1 introduces a method for zero-knowledge attestation validation, enabling the verification of statements between primary and authority accounts without revealing their identities. This system employs a multi-key mechanism to facilitate anonymous validation across separate databases.

US20220200975A1 details a method for zero-knowledge private key management within decentralized applications. It focuses on creating identity smart contracts and managing validators to authenticate users without exposing private keys, enhancing identity verification on blockchain networks. 



While these inventions contribute to privacy-preserving data validation and identity management, they do not address the specific challenges associated with health data verification. Notably, they lack mechanisms for:

Dynamic adjustment of constraint parameters based on environmental factors such as altitude, temperature, and circadian rhythms.

Jurisdiction-aware compliance that automatically aligns with regional health regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) using geolocation metadata.

Operation in resource-constrained or disconnected environments, such as military deployments or remote medical facilities, where real-time connectivity is limited.

Integration with health-specific data sources and the ability to generate zero-knowledge proofs that validate physiological and temporal health constraints without exposing raw biometric data.



The present invention addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive system that:

Aggregates health data from various sources (e.g., wearables, mobile health apps) and performs local validation and cleaning.

Implements a zero-knowledge proof generation engine tailored for health data, incorporating biological plausibility constraints and temporal validation circuits.

Utilizes a blockchain storage layer for immutable proof anchoring, supporting various integration approaches including Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 solutions.

Provides a verification API framework that supports multiple workflow patterns and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.



By addressing the unique requirements of health data verification, this invention offers a novel solution that enhances privacy, compliance, and operational efficiency beyond the capabilities of existing systems.
