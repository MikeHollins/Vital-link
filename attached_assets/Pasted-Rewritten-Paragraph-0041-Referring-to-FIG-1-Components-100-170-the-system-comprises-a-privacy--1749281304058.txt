Rewritten Paragraph [0041]
Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–170), the system comprises a privacy-preserving health data verification architecture designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs from biometric input without exposing unencrypted or personally identifiable biometric data. A data intake module (110) collects biometric and health-related data from heterogeneous sources such as wearable devices, mobile health applications, electronic health records (EHR), and environmental sensors. An environmental metadata module (120) captures contextual information including altitude, climate, and geographic location. A constraint validation module (130) evaluates this input against physiological plausibility, temporal consistency, and jurisdiction-specific compliance rules. For example, if the environmental metadata (120) indicates an altitude of 10,000 feet, the constraint validation module (130) is configured to retrieve a corresponding adjustment factor from a stored lookup table and modify the acceptable physiological range for oxygen saturation from a baseline of "95%-100%" to a context-specific range of "88%-95%". This adjusted range is then passed as a public input to the zero-knowledge proof engine (140). The zero-knowledge proof engine (140) generates proofs attesting to compliance using this constraint satisfaction logic, without revealing underlying data. A blockchain anchoring module (150) immutably records the generated proofs on a distributed ledger. The entire system is secured within a trusted execution environment (160), while a verification interface (170) enables third parties to validate the proof without accessing the original biometric input.

Rewritten Paragraph [0042] with Military Example
Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–270), the constraint validation pipeline is shown in the context of a military readiness verification use case. Biometric data from a soldier's wearable device is processed through a multi-stage logic sequence that evaluates physiological thresholds (210), chronological ordering (220), environmental metadata (240), and jurisdictional policy parameters (250). For instance, to verify fitness for duty, a command authority (a verifier) may require a proof that a soldier has achieved at least four hours of restful sleep (defined as average heart rate below a specified threshold) within the last 24 hours. The circadian rhythm validator (230) can be invoked to ensure these sleep hours occurred during a valid rest period relative to the local time zone of the operational theater, information supplied by the environmental metadata module (240). The pipeline confirms that the data is chronologically sound to prevent replay attacks and that the physiological data is plausible for the given operational environment (e.g., accounting for higher exertion levels). The output is a single, verifiable proof of readiness that satisfies the command's requirements without exposing the soldier's specific, minute-by-minute biometric history.
