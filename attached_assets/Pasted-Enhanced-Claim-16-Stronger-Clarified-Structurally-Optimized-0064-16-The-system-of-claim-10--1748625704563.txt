Enhanced Claim 16 (Stronger, Clarified, Structurally Optimized)

[0064] 16. The system of claim 10, wherein the constraint validation module is configured to dynamically adjust constraint parameters based on:

(i) user-specific demographic and clinical attributes, including age, sex, chronic health conditions, biometric baselines, medication interactions, and genetic risk factors;

(ii) temporal and environmental metadata, including circadian rhythm shifts, altitude compensation zones, real-time air quality index (AQI), barometric pressure, humidity, and thermal exposure data;

(iii) machine-learned biometric patterns derived from time-series sensor data, wherein said patterns are continuously refined by cloud-based or on-device training models to adapt constraint parameters under evolving physiological contexts.

The system further comprises:

(a) a jurisdiction-aware compliance engine configured to identify and enforce regional regulatory requirements by evaluating at least one of: GPS coordinates, IP address resolution, Wi-Fi SSID signatures, or explicitly defined user policy settings;

(b) a dynamic policy loader configured to retrieve and apply constraint templates that conform to regulatory frameworks including HIPAA, GDPR, PIPEDA, PDPA, or jurisdiction-specific medical data governance laws;

(c) a cryptographic audit subsystem configured to log proof-generation events, constraint parameter modifications, and data access transactions using tamper-evident signatures, monotonic timestamps, and verifier endpoint identifiers;

(d) a consent lifecycle management interface configured to: record user consent, associate consent with specific proof-generation actions, and enforce revocation and erasure rights under applicable data protection laws, including GDPR Article 17 (“right to be forgotten”) and HIPAA right-of-access provisions;

(e) an operational fallback module enabling local constraint enforcement and proof generation in disconnected or adversarial environments, with deferred proof anchoring to a blockchain or secure registry upon reconnection.
