TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS

[0023A] The following definitions are provided to clarify the meaning of certain terms as used in this disclosure. These definitions apply throughout the specification, claims, and drawings unless otherwise indicated by context.

[0023B] “Zero-knowledge proof engine” refers to a cryptographic component configured to generate proofs that verify compliance with specified constraints on input data without revealing the data itself. This engine may implement zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, lattice-based protocols, or other post-quantum cryptographic techniques.

[0023C] “Constraint validation module” refers to a logic component or software module that evaluates biometric or contextual data against predefined rules, including physiological plausibility, temporal consistency, and applicable regulatory standards.

[0023D] “Trusted execution environment (TEE)” refers to a hardware-backed secure processing enclave that performs sensitive operations such as validation or proof generation in isolation from general system memory to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

[0023E] “Verification interface” refers to an endpoint or system interface, such as an API, webhook, or smart contract, that enables third parties to validate cryptographic proofs without accessing the underlying biometric data.

[0023F] “Environmental metadata” refers to supplemental context data associated with biometric records, including but not limited to: altitude, GPS coordinates, climate data, jurisdictional location, and temporal markers.

[0023G] “Consent lifecycle management” refers to a privacy management process that governs user permission capture, enforcement, revocation, and audit logging throughout data collection and processing.

[0023H] “Privacy-by-design handling” refers to architectural and procedural features that enforce privacy protections, such as data minimization, anonymization, and scope limitation, at all stages of system operation.

[0023I] “Blockchain anchoring” refers to the process of cryptographically linking proof data or its hash to a blockchain ledger for immutable timestamping and subsequent verification, without revealing the underlying data.

[0023J] “Biometric-specific optimization” refers to computational or logical enhancements designed for particular biometric domains (e.g., cardiovascular, metabolic, sleep data) that improve performance, accuracy, or proof compactness.

[0023K] “Cross-platform standardization” refers to the normalization of biometric data from heterogeneous devices and sources into a unified format suitable for validation and proof generation workflows.

## 📍 EXACT INSERTION POINT

Place this definitions section:

* **Right after your current paragraph \[0023]**, which ends the “Summary of the Invention.”
* **Before paragraph \[0024]**, which begins the “Detailed Description of the Invention.”

So the structure becomes:

```plaintext
[0023] ... end of Summary of the Invention.

[0023A] ← Definitions section begins here.
...
[0023K] ← Definitions section ends here.

[0024] Referring to Figure 1...
```
