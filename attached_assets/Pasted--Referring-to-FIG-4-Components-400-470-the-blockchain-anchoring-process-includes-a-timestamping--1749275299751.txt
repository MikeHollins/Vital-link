 Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–470), the blockchain anchoring process includes a timestamping module (410), an immutability enforcement module (420), and a version control mechanism (430) to support auditability and longitudinal tracking of proof records. A consent record integration module (440) associates proofs with the appropriate authorization history. Anchoring occurs across Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2 networks, or hybrid architectures combining off-chain storage (e.g., IPFS) with on-chain proof hashes.

[0047] Referring to FIG. 5 (Components 500–570), the third-party verification interface enables decentralized proof validation. Secure APIs (510), smart contracts (520), and other standardized endpoints (530) allow verifiers to confirm compliance without exposure to underlying biometric data. The system supports selective disclosure, enabling different verifiers to see different validated attributes depending on policy. Applications include insurance validation, research compliance, and public health enforcement.

[0048] Referring to FIG. 6 (Components 600–670), the privacy and consent lifecycle management module captures, verifies, and logs user authorizations. It includes consent grant and revocation logic (610), jurisdictional constraint enforcement (620), and secure deletion processes (630) to comply with privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA. An audit trail mechanism (640) ensures all consent actions are cryptographically recorded and accessible to regulators or auditors.

[0049] Referring to FIG. 7 (Components 700–770), the system architecture supports edge and mobile deployment scenarios. Wearable sensors, mobile devices, and other constrained hardware are equipped with lightweight ZK proof engines capable of operating offline or in bandwidth-limited conditions. Local proof generation minimizes data exposure risk and supports real-time verification, even in environments with intermittent connectivity or constrained hardware resources. Blockchain anchoring is deferred or conducted via proxy when network access is restored.
