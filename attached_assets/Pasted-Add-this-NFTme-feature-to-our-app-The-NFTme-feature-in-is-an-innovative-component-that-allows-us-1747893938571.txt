Add this NFTme feature to our app. 

The NFTme feature in  is an innovative component that allows users to create and manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) related to their health data achievements and milestones.
Here's what the NFT feature includes:
1. Health Achievement NFTs: Users can mint unique NFTs when they reach significant health milestones, like maintaining a healthy blood pressure for 30 consecutive days or completing fitness challenges.
2. Blockchain Integration: The feature connects to blockchain technology to create verifiable, unique digital assets that represent health accomplishments.
3. NFT Gallery: Users have a personal gallery within the app where they can view their health achievement NFTs and potentially share them with healthcare providers or on social media.
4. Reward Mechanism: The NFTs can serve as both motivational tools and potential rewards that might have value in a health ecosystem (e.g., discounts on health services or products).
The implementation is visible in the server routes with endpoints like:
* /api/nft/create for minting new health achievement NFTs
* /api/users/:userId/nfts for retrieving a user's NFT collection
This feature represents the intersection of blockchain technology and healthcare, providing users with tangible, digital representations of their health journey while maintaining the security and privacy of their health data through blockchain verification.


The NFTme feature should at least be enhanced in several exciting ways, but not limited to,
1. Tiered Achievement System: Create different rarity levels for NFTs based on the difficulty or significance of health achievements. For example:
    * Common: Daily step goals
    * Rare: Monthly consistency awards
    * Epic: Major health improvements
    * Legendary: Life-changing health transformations
2. Health Data Visualization in NFTs: Make each NFT a beautiful, dynamic visualization of the actual health data that earned it. For example, an NFT showing a 3D heart with personalized patterns based on the user's actual heart rate data during a challenge.
3. Community Challenges: Allow groups of users to participate in shared health goals, with special edition NFTs awarded to everyone who completes the community challenge.
4. Healthcare Provider Collaboration: Enable doctors and health professionals to issue special NFTs that certify completion of treatment plans or hitting clinically significant milestones.
5. Marketplace Integration: Create a marketplace where users can showcase their health achievement NFTs, potentially trading them or using them to access premium health content and services.
6. Gamification Elements: Add experience points, levels, and achievement trees where earning certain combinations of health NFTs unlocks special rewards or recognition.
7. Real-world Value Connection: Partner with health insurance companies, fitness brands, or wellness services to provide tangible benefits to users who earn specific health NFTs.
8. AI-Generated Unique Artwork: Use the user's health data patterns as seeds to generate completely unique AI artwork for each NFT, making each achievement truly personal.
9. Social Proof and Sharing: Make it easy for users to share their health achievement NFTs on social media with privacy controls, encouraging social support for health goals.
10. Physical World Connection: Offer options to print limited edition physical represent
