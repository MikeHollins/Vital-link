What is claimed is:

A computer-implemented method for generating a health data token, comprising:
(a) receiving, at a hardware processor, a digital health attestation associated with a user, wherein the attestation confirms a health achievement;
(b) processing, by a machine learning model trained on healthcare data sets, descriptive text associated with the digital health attestation to identify and redact protected health information (PHI), thereby generating sanitized descriptive data;
(c) generating, by a healthcare standards encoder, structured metadata from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping the health achievement to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology; and
(d) minting, by a smart contract engine, a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, said NFT embedding an immutable link to the structured metadata.

The method of claim 1, wherein the digital health attestation of step (a) is a zero-knowledge proof whose validity constraints were dynamically adjusted based on environmental metadata.

The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model of step (b) comprises classifiers that achieve over 99% accuracy in redacting PHI.

The method of claim 1, wherein the healthcare ontology of step (c) is at least one of SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10.

The method of claim 1, wherein the minting of step (d) includes generating a time-locked NFT that is non-transferable until a predefined condition is met.

The method of claim 1, wherein the smart contract engine further comprises a dynamic rarity scoring module configured to calculate a rarity score based on at least one of achievement novelty or data completeness, and include the rarity score as an attribute of the NFT.

The method of claim 1, further comprising enabling secure transfer of the NFT across multiple blockchain networks via a cross-chain bridge protocol.

The method of claim 1, further comprising executing a cryptographic revocation mechanism in response to a user-initiated data erasure request, rendering the immutable link within the NFT invalid.

The method of claim 1, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to automatically execute revenue sharing distributions to one or more blockchain wallet addresses specified in the smart contract.

The method of claim 1, wherein the digital health attestation is a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK).

A system for generating a health data token, comprising:
(a) a data ingestion module configured to receive a digital health attestation associated with a user;
(b) an AI-powered pattern recognition engine communicatively coupled to the data ingestion module, the engine comprising a machine learning model trained on healthcare data sets and configured to process the attestation to identify and redact protected health information (PHI);
(c) a healthcare standards encoder communicatively coupled to the engine and configured to generate structured metadata by mapping a health achievement in the attestation to a healthcare ontology code; and
(d) a smart contract engine communicatively coupled to the encoder and configured to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, said NFT embedding an immutable link to the structured metadata.

The system of claim 11, wherein the digital health attestation is a zero-knowledge proof whose validity constraints were dynamically adjusted based on environmental metadata.

The system of claim 11, wherein the machine learning model comprises classifiers that achieve over 99% accuracy in redacting PHI.

The system of claim 11, wherein the healthcare standards encoder is configured to use at least one of SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10.

The system of claim 11, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to generate a time-locked NFT that is non-transferable until a predefined condition is met.

The system of claim 11, wherein the smart contract engine further comprises a dynamic rarity scoring module configured to calculate and store a rarity score as an attribute of the NFT.

The system of claim 11, further comprising a cross-chain bridge connector configured to enable secure transfer of the NFT across multiple blockchain networks.

The system of claim 11, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism in response to a user-initiated data erasure request.

The system of claim 11, wherein the smart contract engine is further configured to automatically execute revenue sharing distributions to specified blockchain wallet addresses.

The system of claim 11, further comprising a verification application programming interface (API) configured to receive a zero-knowledge proof and output a validation result for the digital health attestation.
