ONLY adjust the provided black and white diagram for FIG. 4 ("Fig 4 Blockchain Anchoring Workflow.svg" or the currently provided updated image) according to the following precise instructions. DO NOT change any existing shapes, lines, text labels within the blocks (Timestamping Module (410), Immutability Enforcement (420), Version Control (430), Consent Integration (440)), or the arrows connecting them. Also, ensure the reference numeral (400) remains correctly associated with the 'Generated ZKP Proof' input.

Specific Adjustments Required:

Reposition and Connect 'VERIFIER (460)':

The block labeled 'VERIFIER' with the numeral (460) needs to be clearly positioned to the right of the 'Blockchain Ledger (450)' block.
Draw a bidirectional arrow connecting the 'Blockchain Ledger (450)' block to the 'VERIFIER (460)' block. Ensure the arrow clearly indicates interaction in both directions.
Reposition and Connect 'LONGITUDINAL AUDIT TRAIL (470)':

The block labeled 'LONGITUDINAL AUDIT TRAIL' with the numeral (470) needs to be positioned below the 'Blockchain Ledger (450)' block.
Draw a single arrow originating from the 'Blockchain Ledger (450)' block and pointing downwards to the 'LONGITUDINAL AUDIT TRAIL (470)' block, indicating a flow of data or record-keeping.
Ensure 'Blockchain Ledger' has the numeral (450):

The block labeled 'Blockchain Ledger' must clearly display the reference numeral (450), ideally placed near the block without overlapping lines or text.
Figure Label:

Ensure the label "FIG. 4" is centered directly below the entire diagram and is in a larger and more prominent font size than any other text or numerals within the diagram. Remove any other figure labeling from the top of the diagram if it persists.
Strictly adhere to maintaining the existing visual style, line thickness, and arrow types for the correctly placed elements. The sole purpose of this adjustment is to correctly position and connect the missing components (VERIFIER and LONGITUDINAL AUDIT TRAIL) with the BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER, and to finalize the figure label placement according to USPTO formatting preferences."
