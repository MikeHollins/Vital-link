### **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION**

\[0043] Referring to FIG. 1 (Components 100–170), the system comprises a privacy-preserving health data verification architecture designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs from biometric input without exposing unencrypted or personally identifiable biometric data. A data intake module (110) collects biometric and health-related data from heterogeneous sources such as wearable devices, mobile health applications, electronic health records (EHR), and environmental sensors. An environmental metadata module (120) captures contextual information including altitude, climate, and geographic location. A constraint validation module (130) evaluates this input against physiological plausibility, temporal consistency, and jurisdiction-specific compliance rules. A zero-knowledge proof engine (140) generates proofs attesting to compliance using constraint satisfaction logic, without revealing underlying data. A blockchain anchoring module (150) immutably records the generated proofs on a distributed ledger. The entire system is secured within a trusted execution environment (160), while a verification interface (170) enables third parties to validate the proof without accessing the original biometric input.

\[0044] Referring to FIG. 2 (Components 200–270), the constraint validation pipeline is shown in greater detail. Biometric data is processed through a multi-stage logic sequence that evaluates physiological thresholds, chronological ordering, environmental metadata, and jurisdictional policy parameters. A circadian rhythm validator (230) may be invoked when biometric time-series data is present, enabling time zone- and chronotype-aware validation without requiring continuous sleep tracking. Regulatory constraints are dynamically enforced using policy configuration profiles linked to geographic metadata. The output is a constraint validation result that determines whether the biometric input satisfies system requirements.

\[0045] Referring to FIG. 3 (Components 300–370), the internal architecture of the zero-knowledge proof engine includes modules for handling public inputs (310), encrypted private biometric inputs (320), and cryptographic scheme selection (330). Supported proof types include zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, and quantum-resistant constructions such as lattice-based proofs. Privacy boundaries are enforced through strict separation of data inputs and outputs, ensuring the cryptographic proof reveals no sensitive information. The engine is optimized for real-time proof generation on constrained hardware platforms.

\[0046] Referring to FIG. 4 (Components 400–470), the blockchain anchoring process includes a timestamping module (410), an immutability enforcement module (420), and a version control mechanism (430) to support auditability and longitudinal tracking of proof records. A consent record integration module (440) associates proofs with the appropriate authorization history. Anchoring occurs across Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2 networks, or hybrid architectures combining off-chain storage (e.g., IPFS) with on-chain proof hashes.

\[0047] Referring to FIG. 5 (Components 500–570), the third-party verification interface enables decentralized proof validation. Secure APIs (510), smart contracts (520), and other standardized endpoints (530) allow verifiers to confirm compliance without exposure to underlying biometric data. The system supports selective disclosure, enabling different verifiers to see different validated attributes depending on policy. Applications include insurance validation, research compliance, and public health enforcement.

\[0048] Referring to FIG. 6 (Components 600–670), the privacy and consent lifecycle management module captures, verifies, and logs user authorizations. It includes consent grant and revocation logic (610), jurisdictional constraint enforcement (620), and secure deletion processes (630) to comply with privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA. An audit trail mechanism (640) ensures all consent actions are cryptographically recorded and accessible to regulators or auditors.

\[0049] Referring to FIG. 7 (Components 700–770), the system architecture supports edge and mobile deployment scenarios. Wearable sensors, mobile devices, and other constrained hardware are equipped with lightweight ZK proof engines capable of operating offline or in bandwidth-limited conditions. Local proof generation minimizes data exposure risk and supports real-time verification, even in environments with intermittent connectivity or constrained hardware resources. Blockchain anchoring is deferred or conducted via proxy when network access is restored.
