 [0001] ABSTRACT  

A computer-implemented method and system for privacy-preserving verification of health data using zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs. The invention enables validation of biometric data against defined physiological and temporal constraints without disclosing the underlying measurements. Biometric data is collected from health monitoring devices, validated using constraint satisfaction circuits, and converted into zero-knowledge proofs using zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, or future-proof quantum-resistant protocols. The proofs are stored immutably on blockchain networks, supporting cross-platform verification.




 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  


 [0002]   It is an object of the present invention to:


  Provide a privacy-preserving method for verifying biometric data compliance without disclosing underlying health information.

  Replace trust-based reporting systems with cryptographic verification mechanisms.

  Enable scalable third-party health data validation using zero-knowledge proofs.

  Reduce fraud in wellness programs and insurance claims.

  Comply with regulatory requirements including HIPAA, GDPR, and emerging privacy laws.


  \[0003]   Current health data verification systems require the transmission and inspection of raw biometric data such as heart rate, sleep metrics, and activity records. This exposes highly sensitive personal information and creates substantial privacy, regulatory, and security risks. Most systems rely on trust-based, manual verification or centralized data aggregation, which are vulnerable to fraud, incompatible with GDPR and HIPAA compliance, and unsuitable for large-scale, real-time health monitoring.


  \[0004]   Additionally, conventional solutions cannot provide cryptographic assurances of data validity. Self-reporting leads to 23–31% fraud rates in health programs. Manual verification methods are slow, expensive, and not scalable beyond institutional deployments. They also fail to meet data minimization and auditability requirements under GDPR Article 5 and HIPAA’s minimum necessary standards.


  \[0005]   There is no existing system that can prove biometric data meets health requirements while preserving privacy, ensuring immutability, and enabling scalable third-party validation. This invention solves these problems by introducing a cryptographically verifiable, zero-knowledge proof-based health data validation system that requires no data disclosure.


  \[0006]   The system architecture supports modular deployment across mobile, edge, and cloud environments. It includes privacy enforcement features such as user consent capture, audit trail logging, and data deletion in compliance with GDPR and HIPAA. Support for hardware acceleration and multi-party computation (MPC) allows scalable, decentralized, and secure proof generation. Verification APIs enable integration with healthcare providers, insurers, researchers, and regulatory systems. This invention reduces cost, improves throughput, and ensures cryptographic privacy in health data verification processes.

###   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  


  \[0008]   Proof sizes remain under 100kB and verification times under 500ms per record using zk-SNARK implementation benchmarks, ensuring efficiency and scalability for real-time applications.


  \[0009]   Unlike traditional systems that rely on trusted intermediaries or full data disclosure, this invention uses cryptographic proofs tailored to biological and regulatory constraints—enabling privacy-preserving health data validation with no raw data exposure. The combination of zero-knowledge proofs with domain-specific biometric constraints and blockchain anchoring is not found in the prior art, and offers technical capabilities not previously addressed in healthcare compliance, fraud prevention, or telemedicine platforms.


  \[0010]   The present invention addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving, fraud-resistant, and scalable health data verification. It introduces a system and method that leverage zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to validate compliance with health constraints—such as physiological thresholds and temporal behavior patterns—without exposing the underlying biometric data.


  \[0011]   This invention includes:


  A modular system architecture capable of collecting, normalizing, and validating biometric data from various sources, including wearables, mobile health apps, and connected medical devices.

  A constraint satisfaction engine designed for physiological plausibility and time-consistency checks, powered by customizable logic circuits and enhanced with GPU and ASIC acceleration capabilities.

  Zero-knowledge proof generation supporting zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, and future-proof quantum-resistant algorithms.

  A blockchain-integrated proof anchoring system compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, IPFS, and cross-chain protocols, ensuring data immutability and auditability.

  A privacy and consent management layer that enforces user permissions, generates audit trails, and supports the right-to-erasure and regulatory compliance under HIPAA and GDPR.


  \[0012]   Additionally, the system supports:


  Interoperability with enterprise health record systems (EHR/EMR) and smart contract platforms.

  Multi-party computation (MPC) configurations, enabling collaborative verification without centralized data access.

  A scalable verification interface capable of real-time, batch, and event-triggered data validation workflows.


  \[0013]   This architecture delivers a robust foundation for privacy-first health data verification across applications in clinical trials, insurance claims, employer wellness programs, public health, and medical device validation—achieving substantial reductions in cost, latency, and risk compared to conventional manual and centralized systems.
