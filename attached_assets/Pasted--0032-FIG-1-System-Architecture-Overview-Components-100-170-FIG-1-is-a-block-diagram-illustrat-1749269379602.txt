[0032] FIG. 1: System Architecture Overview (Components 100–170)
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the overall system architecture for privacy-preserving health data verification. The architecture includes biometric data intake modules (100), constraint validation logic (110), a zero-knowledge proof generation engine (120), a blockchain anchoring interface (130), and a verifier interface (140). These components are orchestrated within a trusted execution environment (160) and supported by jurisdiction-aware policy selectors (170) to ensure regional compliance. The modular design enables scalable deployment across cloud, edge, and mobile environments.

[0033] FIG. 2: Constraint Validation Pipeline (Components 200–270)
FIG. 2 is a logic flow diagram depicting how incoming biometric data is assessed against physiological thresholds, temporal patterns, and jurisdiction-specific policies. The pipeline incorporates environmental metadata (210) for dynamic rule adjustment and includes an optional circadian validation module (220) when relevant biometric time series data is present. Regulatory compliance filters (230) and probabilistic inference modules (240) handle partial, noisy, or asynchronous signals. Output is passed to proof generation upon successful constraint satisfaction.

[0034] FIG. 3: Zero-Knowledge Proof Engine (Components 300–380)
FIG. 3 illustrates the internal architecture of the zero-knowledge proof engine. Public inputs (310) include constraint parameters and regulatory flags; private inputs (320) contain encrypted biometric data. A dynamic scheme selector (330) routes data through appropriate proof frameworks such as zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, or lattice-based systems. A privacy enforcement boundary (340) ensures data minimization and non-retention. The proof compiler (350) generates tamper-evident cryptographic outputs, optimized for mobile and edge platforms via GPU/ASIC acceleration modules (360). The engine supports incremental updates and multi-party threshold proofs (370).

[0035] FIG. 4: Blockchain Anchoring and Audit Trail (Components 400–470)
FIG. 4 is a process diagram illustrating how generated proofs are anchored to a blockchain for tamper-resistance and future verification. Timestamping logic (410), smart contract integration (420), and audit log hash generation (430) ensure cryptographic integrity. Proof versioning (440) and revocation markers (450) enable up-to-date tracking of consented validations. Anchoring options include Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2 rollups (460), and decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) with on-chain hashes for scalability and compliance.

[0036] FIG. 5: Verification Interface and Smart Contract Integration (Components 500–580)
FIG. 5 is a deployment diagram illustrating the secure interface for third-party verification. Verifiers such as insurers, regulators, and researchers access proofs via REST APIs (510), GraphQL endpoints (520), or smart contracts (530). The interface includes selective disclosure controls (540) and jurisdiction-based policy filtering (550). Automated verification flows (560) support batch processing, consent validation, and compliance logging, ensuring no access to underlying biometric data.

[0037] FIG. 6: Consent Lifecycle and Privacy Handling (Components 600–670)
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating consent lifecycle enforcement and privacy-by-design handling. The system records consent grants and revocations (610), logs authorization scopes (620), and enforces jurisdiction-aware filtering (630). Automated data deletion workflows (640), GDPR/HIPAA compliance triggers (650), and immutable audit logs (660) provide verifiability and reversibility across consent events. The privacy module (670) ensures all downstream processing aligns with current consent status.

[0038] FIG. 7: Edge and Mobile Proof Generation (Components 700–770)
FIG. 7 is a deployment architecture diagram illustrating zero-knowledge proof generation workflows on edge and mobile platforms such as wearable sensors (710), smartphones (720), and portable edge nodes (730). Resource-optimized constraint validation engines (740) and local blockchain anchoring options (750) support offline or bandwidth-constrained operation. The module includes local consent validation (760) and sync logic (770) for delayed anchoring and verification once connectivity is restored.
