"CREATE a new, black and white deployment architecture diagram for FIG. 7, illustrating 'Edge and Mobile Proof Generation' exactly as described below. Focus on precise component representation, containment, data flow, and strict adherence to USPTO drawing rules.

General Drawing Rules (Reiterate - apply to this figure):

Strictly black and white. No shades of gray or color.
Clear, uniformly thick, solid black lines.
No frames around the diagram.
All text labels (block names, arrow labels) in ALL CAPS.
All reference numerals in Arabic numerals (e.g., 710), placed clearly near the corresponding component.
Figure label "FIG. 7" centered directly below the entire diagram (remove any top label).
Diagram must be legible and fit within standard margins.
Components and their Reference Numerals & Visual Representation:

RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720): This is the main container. Draw a large, prominent rectangular block labeled 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE' (720). All internal components (710, 730, 740, 750) will be drawn inside this box.
WEARABLE SENSORS (710): Draw a small sensor-like icon or block labeled 'WEARABLE SENSORS' (710) positioned inside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box.
RAW BIOMETRIC DATA (740): Draw a data storage icon (e.g., a simple cylinder or database symbol) labeled 'RAW BIOMETRIC DATA' (740) positioned inside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box.
LIGHTWEIGHT ZK PROOF ENGINE (730): Draw a rectangular block labeled 'LIGHTWEIGHT ZK PROOF ENGINE' (730) positioned inside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box.
IMMUTABLY STORED PROOF (750): Draw a document or data packet icon labeled 'IMMUTABLY STORED PROOF' (750) positioned inside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box.
TACTICAL NETWORKS (760): Draw a cloud shape labeled 'TACTICAL NETWORKS' (760) outside and to the right of the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)'.
COMMAND POST (NETWORK ACCESS) (770): Draw a rectangular block labeled 'COMMAND POST (NETWORK ACCESS)' (770) to the right of 'TACTICAL NETWORKS (760)'.
BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING (780): Draw a rectangular process block labeled 'BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING' (780) to the right of 'COMMAND POST (NETWORK ACCESS) (770)'.
DISTRIBUTED LEDGER (450): Draw a cylinder or cloud shape labeled 'DISTRIBUTED LEDGER' (450) to the right of 'BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING (780)'.
Flow and Relationships (Arrows):

Within RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720):

Draw a unidirectional arrow from WEARABLE SENSORS (710) to RAW BIOMETRIC DATA (740).
Draw a unidirectional arrow from RAW BIOMETRIC DATA (740) to LIGHTWEIGHT ZK PROOF ENGINE (730).
Draw a unidirectional arrow from LIGHTWEIGHT ZK PROOF ENGINE (730) to IMMUTABLY STORED PROOF (750).
CRUCIAL VISUAL CUE: Ensure NO ARROW LEADS OUTWARD from the RAW BIOMETRIC DATA (740) block to any component outside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box.
From RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720) to External Systems (Deferred Anchoring):

Draw a unidirectional arrow from IMMUTABLY STORED PROOF (750) (originating from inside the 'RUGGEDIZED MOBILE DEVICE (720)' box) to TACTICAL NETWORKS (760). This arrow can be labeled 'DEFERRED ANCHORING'.
Through External Systems:

Draw a unidirectional arrow from TACTICAL NETWORKS (760) to COMMAND POST (NETWORK ACCESS) (770).
Draw a unidirectional arrow from COMMAND POST (NETWORK ACCESS) (770) to BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING (780).
Draw a unidirectional arrow from BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING (780) to DISTRIBUTED LEDGER (450).
Stylistic Notes:

Ensure all components are clearly separated and the overall flow is easy to follow from left to right.
All component labels and numerals must be clear and legible.
All arrows should be distinct and not overlapping.
