BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to the field of automated data processing systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods that utilize machine learning models for the context-aware sanitization of sensitive information within unstructured text documents. The disclosure further pertains to the subsequent generation of structured, machine-readable metadata from the sanitized text using standardized ontologies, thereby creating a privacy-preserving and computationally useful data asset.
Description of Related Art
[0002] Current health data monetization systems suffer from privacy violations and regulatory compliance failures. Existing approaches include: (1) Direct Health Data Sales that expose personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), violating HIPAA regulations; (2) Centralized Health Data Marketplaces that create single points of failure and privacy breaches; (3) Basic NFT Systems that lack healthcare-specific compliance features and regulatory safeguards; and (4) Traditional Health Data Sharing that requires complete data exposure for verification purposes.
[0003] None of these solutions provide a method for creating tradeable health data assets while maintaining regulatory compliance and privacy protection through automated PHI sanitization and blockchain-based verification.
[0004] Furthermore, the state of the art includes explorations into related technologies. For instance, academic frameworks like 'RedactOR' by Singh et al. and 'INTACT' by Lison et al. teach advanced methods for de-identifying text using Large Language Models while preserving semantic context. Concurrently, patents like U.S. Pat. No. 11,782,942 to Liang et al. teach methods for linking unstructured clinical notes to structured data resources, including those similar to ontologies.
[0005] However, none of these references, alone or in combination, teach or suggest the specific, sequential process of the present invention. Specifically, the prior art does not disclose a method wherein the semantically preserved, sanitized text itself is used as the direct input for a programmatic data encoder to create a new layer of structured, ontology-mapped metadata. This unique step of structuring the privacy-preserved output—rather than the original sensitive input—solves the critical problem of creating a data asset that is simultaneously safe for analysis, structurally queryable, and verifiably compliant, a key technical advantage not addressed by the prior art.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006] The present invention provides systems and methods for transforming unstructured text documents containing sensitive information into privacy-preserving, structured data assets. The invention leverages a synergistic combination of a specialized machine learning model for context-aware redaction and a data encoder for mapping sanitized information to standardized ontologies.
[0007] In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method is disclosed. The method comprises receiving an unstructured text document at a hardware processor. A machine learning model, which has been trained on a domain-specific corpus, processes the document to identify and redact text portions corresponding to predefined categories of sensitive information, such as Protected Health Information (PHI). A key aspect of this processing is the preservation of the grammatical structure and semantic context of the text surrounding the redacted portions. Subsequently, a data encoder programmatically maps facts and events from the sanitized text to codes from a standardized ontology to generate structured metadata. The final output is a data object, stored in memory, that comprises both the human-readable sanitized text and the machine-readable structured metadata.
[0008] In another embodiment, a system for performing this method is provided. The system comprises a data ingestion module configured to receive the unstructured text document. Communicatively coupled to the ingestion module is an AI redaction engine, which contains the machine learning model for performing the context-aware redaction. A data encoder is communicatively coupled to the AI redaction engine and is configured to generate the structured metadata using the standardized ontology. Finally, a data storage interface is configured to store the resulting data object.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Terminology and Definitions
[0013] The following definitions are provided to clarify the meaning of certain terms as used in this disclosure. These definitions apply throughout the specification, claims, and drawings unless otherwise indicated by context.
[0014] "Digital Health Attestation" refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject. Such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, data streams from a verified biometric sensor, or a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, confirming compliance with a set of health parameters.
[0015] "Protected Health Information (PHI)" is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health1 care service. This includes, but is not limited to, the 18 identifiers specified by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, such as names, geographic subdivisions, dates, telephone numbers, and Social Security numbers.
[0016] "Healthcare Ontology" refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain. For the purposes of this invention, it is a classification system, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10, used by the data encoder to programmatically map unstructured health facts into structured, interoperable, and machine-readable codes.
[0017] "Non-Fungible Token (NFT)" refers to a unique and non-interchangeable cryptographic token residing on a blockchain that represents ownership, authenticity, or proof of existence of a unique digital or physical asset. In the context of the present invention, an NFT is minted to serve as a verifiable, tradeable digital asset that represents a specific, sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link to its corresponding structured metadata.
Description of the Drawings
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrating the overall system architecture (100) is shown. The system is configured to transform an unstructured text document into a privacy-preserving, structured data asset. The system comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110), an AI Redaction Engine (120), a Data Encoder (130), and a Data Storage Interface (140), which are communicatively coupled to process data in a sequential workflow.
[0019] It is a key technical advantage of the present architecture (100) that the Data Encoder (130) is positioned after the AI Redaction Engine (120). This ensures that the module responsible for creating structured data only ever processes the sanitized, privacy-preserving text, never the original document containing sensitive information. This segregation of duties within the data pipeline is a critical feature for maintaining compliance and minimizing data exposure risk.
[0020] In an exemplary embodiment for the healthcare and pharmaceutical research industry, the system (100) is used to unlock vast amounts of clinical data for life-saving research. A research hospital can use the Data Ingestion Module (110) to process thousands of unstructured electronic health records. The AI Redaction Engine (120) then identifies and redacts all 18 categories of Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA, such as names and addresses, while preserving the critical clinical context. The Data Encoder (130) maps the sanitized clinical facts—like diagnoses, medications, and lab results—to standardized healthcare ontologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC. The resulting anonymized but richly structured data objects are stored via the Data Storage Interface (140) and can then be safely licensed to pharmaceutical companies to dramatically accelerate clinical trials and drug discovery, all while the individual patient's privacy is cryptographically preserved.
[0021] Referring now to FIG. 2, a flowchart illustrating the core method steps (200) is shown. The method begins at step 210, where an unstructured text document is received. At step 220, a machine learning model processes the document to identify sensitive information. At step 230, a sanitized text document is generated by redacting the identified information while preserving semantic context. At step 240, a data encoder generates structured metadata using a standardized ontology. Finally, at step 250, a final data object comprising both the sanitized text and the structured metadata is generated and stored, representing the final asset (260).
[0022] In another exemplary embodiment for the financial services industry, this method (200) is used to enhance regulatory compliance and risk analysis. A large investment bank receives thousands of internal communications and transaction reports as unstructured text (step 210). The method processes these documents to identify and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of clients and employees (steps 220 and 230). The system then maps key events in the sanitized text to a financial ontology (step 240), tagging for concepts like "large_cash_withdrawal" or "trade_settlement_inquiry." The final data object (260) allows a compliance officer's analytics software to scan for patterns of high-risk behavior across the entire institution without ever exposing the private data of an individual client or employee, thus providing a significant benefit to both the institution and its customers.
[0023] Referring now to FIG. 3, a diagram providing a detailed conceptual view of the AI redaction process (300) is shown, illustrating the key feature of semantic preservation. An Input Text (310) containing sensitive information is received by the AI Redaction Engine (320). The engine identifies and redacts the sensitive entities to produce a sanitized Output Text (330) where the original grammatical structure and meaning are preserved.
[0024] For instance, in a legal technology use case for M&A due diligence, an Input Text (310) from a corporate contract might read: "On May 1st, 2024, ACME Corp. shall pay a penalty of $5,000,000 to Zenith Inc. if the merger is delayed." The AI Redaction Engine (320) identifies "ACME Corp." and "Zenith Inc." as sensitive party names. The resulting Output Text (330) would be: "On May 1st, 2024, [PARTY A] shall pay a penalty of $5,000,000 to [PARTY B] if the merger is delayed." The critical financial obligation and temporal data are perfectly preserved for analysis, while the confidential identities of the parties are protected.
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 4, a diagram illustrating the exemplary data structure of the final output Data Object (400) is shown. The data object comprises at least two primary fields: a Sanitized Text Field (410) and a Structured Metadata Field (420).
[0026] Continuing the legal tech use case, the Data Object (400) generated from the contract in FIG. 3 would be structured as follows. The Sanitized Text Field (410) would contain the human-readable text: "On [DATE], [PARTY A] shall pay a penalty of...". The Structured Metadata Field (420) would contain machine-readable JSON, programmatically generated by the data encoder from a legal ontology: { "clause_type": "liquidated_damages", "penalty_amount": "5000000", "currency": "USD", "trigger_event": "merger_delay" }. This dual structure is highly beneficial, as it allows a team of lawyers to read the sanitized contract for nuance while an automated system can instantly aggregate and analyze the financial risks across thousands of similar contracts.
