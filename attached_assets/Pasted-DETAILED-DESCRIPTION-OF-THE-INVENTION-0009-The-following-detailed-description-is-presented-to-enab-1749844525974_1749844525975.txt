DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0009] The following detailed description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. For purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature and embodiments are set forth to provide a thorough understanding. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. The descriptions of specific embodiments are provided for purpose of illustration and representation, not limitation.

Terminology and Definitions
To ensure clarity and to control the interpretation of the claims appended hereto, the following terms are defined as follows:

[0010] “Digital Health Attestation” refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject and comprises descriptive text. In various embodiments, such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, authenticated text streams from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, data streams from a verified wearable biometric sensor, or a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, confirming compliance with a set of health parameters.

[0011] “Protected Health Information (PHI)” is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service.

[0012] “Healthcare Ontology” refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10. The use of such an ontology enables semantic interoperability for the data processed by the system.

[0013] "Sanitized Descriptive Data" refers to the output generated by the AI-powered pattern recognition engine after it has programmatically transformed the descriptive text of a digital health attestation by identifying and redacting PHI while preserving the underlying semantic context.

[0014] "Structured Metadata Object" refers to a new digital data structure programmatically generated by the healthcare standards encoder. This object is created from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping a health-related fact therein to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. Critically, this object is created and stored in an off-chain environment.

[0015] “Non-Fungible Token (NFT)” refers to a unique cryptographic token residing on a blockchain. In the context of the present invention, an NFT serves as a verifiable and tradeable representation of a sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link pointing exclusively to its corresponding off-chain Structured Metadata Object.

System Architecture and Operation
[0016] A primary technical barrier preventing the tokenization of health data is the significant legal and privacy risk of immutably recording PHI on a public, distributed ledger. The present invention overcomes this barrier by providing a specific, non-obvious architectural solution that programmatically transforms health data into a verifiable and tradeable token without ever exposing PHI to the blockchain. The system is architected to perform a specific sequence of off-chain transformations prior to any on-chain transaction, thereby creating a new type of digital health asset that is verifiably compliant by design.

[0017] The system and its method of operation will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Description of the Drawings
[0018] Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrates the overall system architecture (100) for generating a regulatory-compliant health data token. The system comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110), which is a hardware and/or software component configured to receive a digital health attestation comprising descriptive text. The Data Ingestion Module (110) is communicatively coupled to an AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120).

[0019] The Engine (120) comprises a machine learning model implemented on a hardware processor. It is configured to receive the descriptive text and programmatically transform it into sanitized descriptive data by identifying and redacting PHI. In certain embodiments, the Engine (120) may be a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on medical corpora, or it may comprise recurrent neural networks (RNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), or an ensemble of multiple classifier types to achieve robust PHI redaction.

[0020] The Engine (120) is communicatively coupled to a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130). The Encoder (130) is configured to receive the sanitized descriptive data and, in an off-chain environment, programmatically generate a new structured metadata object. This is achieved by mapping a health-related fact from the sanitized descriptive data to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology.

[0021] The Encoder (130) is communicatively coupled to a Smart Contract Engine (140). The Engine (140) is configured to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain. The minted NFT is specifically configured to embed an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain structured metadata object. The system may further comprise a Verification API (150) to allow external systems to verify aspects of the token or its underlying data, for instance by processing a zero-knowledge proof.

[0022] Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart illustrates the core data transformation process. The process begins with the receipt of a Verified Health Attestation (210). The attestation undergoes AI-Powered PHI Sanitization (220), corresponding to the function of the Engine (120), to produce the sanitized descriptive data. Next, the sanitized data undergoes Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding (230), corresponding to the function of the Encoder (130), to generate the new structured metadata object. A Cryptographic Commitment (240), such as a hash of the structured metadata object, may be generated. The process culminates in NFT Minting (250), corresponding to the function of the Smart Contract Engine (140), to create the final Compliant Health NFT (260), which is both verifiable and tradeable.

[0023] Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrates a preferred embodiment wherein the system operates in synergy with a dynamic zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. A Dynamic ZK Verification System (310) generates a Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320). This ZKP serves as the digital health attestation received by the NFTME System (330), which represents the overall system (100) of the present invention. This embodiment is particularly advantageous as the input itself is privacy-preserving by nature.

[0024] Referring to FIG. 4, a diagram illustrates an exemplary data structure for the metadata embedded within the NFT itself or within the linked off-chain object. The structure may comprise fields such as attestation_type (410) (e.g., 'ZKP', 'Lab Result'), subject_attestation_hash (420) (a cryptographic hash for data integrity checks), the immutable_link (430) to the full off-chain structured metadata object, and a validation_method (440) field indicating how the attestation's authenticity can be verified. In a preferred embodiment, the immutable_link (430) is a content-identifier (CID) for a file stored on a decentralized storage system such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Exemplary Embodiments and Additional Features
[0025] The Smart Contract Engine (140) can be configured with additional logic modules to enhance the functionality of the minted NFT. For instance, a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) Module may be included. This computer-implemented module programmatically calculates a numerical ADS by comparing the ontology-mapped structured metadata of the attestation against a historical database of previously processed attestations to determine statistical novelty, thereby providing a metric for the asset's potential value for research or analysis.

[0026] In other embodiments, the smart contract may implement a time-locking mechanism, wherein the NFT is non-transferable until a specific on-chain or off-chain condition is met, verified via an oracle. Furthermore, the system may execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism, wherein a user-initiated data erasure request triggers an update to a public revocation list or a state change in the smart contract, thereby allowing verifiers to confirm that the immutable link within the NFT is no longer considered valid.
