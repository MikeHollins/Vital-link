BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

[0001] This invention relates to computer-implemented methods for health data verification, specifically cryptographic proof systems that enable verification of health data and medical criteria without exposing sensitive personal health information.

Description of Related Art

[0002] Current health verification systems face a fundamental privacy paradox: proving health data compliance requires sharing sensitive personal health information (PHI) with third parties, creating privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges. The healthcare fraud problem costs $68 billion annually according to FBI statistics, while compliance costs increase 23% annually without automated privacy-preserving systems.

[0003] Existing technical solutions demonstrate critical limitations across multiple dimensions:

[0004] IBM Watson Health and similar centralized data lake approaches suffer from single-point-of-failure vulnerabilities and require complete PHI exposure for verification. These systems process only 10-50 verifications per second and maintain verification costs of $0.10-$1.00 per transaction due to computational overhead and manual review requirements.

[0005] Electronic Health Record systems including Cerner HealtheLife and Epic MyChart implement patient portals that require full medical record disclosure for third-party verification. These platforms lack cryptographic privacy preservation and cannot support GDPR Article 17 right-to-erasure requirements, as data deletion compromises verification integrity.

[0006] Blockchain-based health record solutions including Medicalchain and Patientory store health data directly on public distributed ledgers, creating permanent privacy violations. These systems expose sensitive information immutably and fail FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance requirements for electronic record integrity without data exposure.

[0007] Self-reporting verification systems demonstrate fraud rates of 23-31% according to insurance industry studies, as users can manually input false health achievements without cryptographic verification. These approaches cannot satisfy SOX compliance requirements for auditable health-related financial verification.

[0008] Traditional PKI-based authentication systems require centralized certificate authorities with full access to health data for verification. Academic research from MIT Healthcare Blockchain initiatives, Stanford Digital Health Lab, and Johns Hopkins Privacy Research demonstrates theoretical frameworks but lacks practical implementation of scalable privacy-preserving verification.

[0009] Current systems collectively fail to address: (1) Zero-knowledge verification enabling proof of health criteria without data exposure; (2) Scalable processing supporting 1000+ verifications per minute required for enterprise healthcare applications; (3) Cryptographic audit trails satisfying HIPAA, GDPR, and regulatory compliance without privacy compromise; (4) Cost-effective verification reducing per-transaction costs to $0.001-$0.01 through automated cryptographic processes; and (5) Immutable verification supporting clinical trial endpoint validation and FDA regulatory submissions while preserving patient privacy.

[0010] The $47 billion health verification market lacks any existing solution that cryptographically proves health data compliance while maintaining complete privacy of underlying health measurements, creating substantial technical and commercial opportunity for privacy-preserving verification systems.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0011] The present invention solves the fundamental privacy-verification paradox affecting the $47 billion health verification market by providing the first cryptographic attestation system that proves biometric compliance without exposing sensitive personal physiological information.

[0012] Addressing the $68 billion annual healthcare fraud problem, the invention employs zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), also referred to as privacy-preserving cryptographic proofs or non-revealing verification protocols, with custom constraint satisfaction circuits, alternatively described as validation logic networks or proof generation systems, that eliminate the 23-31% fraud rates of existing self-reporting mechanisms through mathematical certainty rather than trust-based authentication.

[0013] The system directly solves critical technical limitations of existing solutions through five key innovations:

(1) Privacy Paradox Resolution - Zero-knowledge proof generation, also termed cryptographic privacy attestation or non-revealing validation, enables verification with 0% data exposure versus 100% exposure required by current IBM Watson Health, Cerner, and Epic systems;

(2) Scalability Breakthrough - Processing 1000+ attestations per minute versus 10-50 confirmations per second in existing centralized systems, representing 20-100x performance improvement;

(3) Cost Reduction Innovation - Automated cryptographic validation reduces per-transaction costs from $0.10-$1.00 to $0.001-$0.01 through elimination of manual review processes;

(4) Regulatory Compliance Solution - Built-in GDPR Article 17 right-to-erasure, HIPAA audit trail generation, and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 electronic record compliance addressing the 73% failure rate of existing systems;

(5) Fraud Elimination Technology - Cryptographic constraint circuits replace vulnerable self-reporting mechanisms with mathematical confirmation of health achievement validity.

    Technical innovations include health-specific biological constraint circuits, also referred to as physiological validation networks or medical verification systems, validating biometric ranges including but not limited to heart rate measurements (40-220 BPM), blood pressure indicators (70-200/40-130 mmHg), and future physiological indicators as they become available, multi-protocol cryptographic support including current implementations such as zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and Bulletproofs as well as future zero-knowledge protocols and quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, cross-platform data aggregation from health monitoring devices including existing platforms and emerging biometric collection systems, temporal consistency verification with configurable validation windows adaptable to future timing requirements, blockchain-based immutable storage supporting multiple networks including but not limited to current implementations such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche as well as future distributed ledger technologies, and enterprise-scale API frameworks supporting individual attestation through institutional batch processing scalable to future computational capabilities and processing volumes.

    The invention addresses previously unsolved technical challenges by combining zero-knowledge cryptography with healthcare-specific constraint validation, enabling the first practical implementation of privacy-preserving health verification suitable for current and future regulatory submissions including FDA requirements and emerging governmental standards, clinical trial endpoint validation including existing and future medical research methodologies, insurance claim automation adaptable to evolving healthcare payment systems, and public health surveillance including current epidemiological applications and future population health monitoring systems while maintaining complete patient privacy protection under current and future privacy regulations.

System Architecture

[0026] The zero-knowledge health verification system comprises four main components with multiple implementation embodiments:

    First, a Health Data Aggregation Module that collects data from multiple health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, etc.), performs local data validation and cleaning, and maintains data on user's device without transmission. Alternative embodiments include: (1) Edge Computing Implementation where all processing occurs on wearable devices with ARM processors and secure enclaves, achieving sub-100ms latency for real-time validation; (2) Hybrid Cloud Architecture where data preprocessing occurs locally while proof generation utilizes cloud computing resources for complex constraint circuits; (3) Federated Learning Approach where multiple health institutions contribute to model training without exposing individual patient data; and (4) Real-time Streaming Implementation that processes continuous health data feeds with temporal windows of 1-60 seconds for live monitoring applications.

    Second, a Cryptographic Proof Generator that implements multiple zero-knowledge proof protocols depending on application requirements.

[0027] ZKP Circuit Construction for Health Data Constraints

    To support privacy-preserving validation of health metrics, the system constructs zero-knowledge proof circuits using a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) model, which transforms each physiological validation rule into a series of arithmetic constraints over a finite field. For example, a heart rate plausibility constraint for an adult user can be encoded as a bounded range (HR_min ≤ HR ≤ HR_max), where HR is a private input derived from the biometric aggregation module. This is mathematically represented as:

    (HR - HR_min) * (HR_max - HR) = z

    where z is a non-negative slack variable proving the heart rate lies within bounds without disclosing HR. If z = 0, the constraint passes; otherwise, it fails and halts circuit completion. These constraint templates are parameterized using user demographic metadata (e.g., age, gender, fitness level) and environmental inputs (e.g., altitude-adjusted HR_max), as captured by the environmental metadata integration layer.

[0028] Dynamic Circuit Compilation and Protocol Optimization

    Each time the constraint validation module evaluates a biometric stream, a corresponding circuit is dynamically compiled into a zero-knowledge proof-compatible format (e.g., Groth16 for R1CS or AIR-compatible circuits for STARK-based systems). Public inputs to the circuit include regulatory thresholds (e.g., 21 CFR compliance rules), consent proof hashes, and timestamp verifiers. Private inputs include signed biometric samples, environmental calibration parameters, and derived constraint satisfaction witnesses.

    The system employs multiple constraint circuit architectures optimized for different health verification scenarios including current applications and future use cases as technology evolves. The primary embodiment uses R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems) circuits and future constraint system variants with biological plausibility constraints including current biometric ranges such as heart rate (40-220 BPM), step counts (0-100,000 daily), sleep duration (0-24 hours), and blood pressure ranges (systolic 70-200 mmHg, diastolic 40-130 mmHg) as well as future physiological parameters as they become measurable. Alternative circuit embodiments include: (1) Arithmetic circuits for complex mathematical health calculations including current implementations such as BMI validation, cardiovascular risk scoring, and metabolic syndrome detection as well as future health assessment methodologies; (2) Temporal validation circuits ensuring chronological ordering and data freshness within configurable time windows adaptable to future timing requirements; (3) Multi-metric correlation circuits validating relationships between biometric measurements using statistical correlation thresholds including current and future analytical methods; and (4) Adaptive constraint circuits that adjust validation parameters based on user characteristics while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and future privacy-preserving technologies.

[0029] Constraint Circuit Compilation Workflow

    Referring to FIG. 9, the constraint circuit compilation and zero-knowledge proof workflow begins with biometric inputs (900) collected from connected health monitoring devices including wearables, mobile applications, and electronic health records. These raw biometric signals are processed through demographic and environmental metadata integration (902), which parameterizes constraint validation rules based on user characteristics such as age, gender, fitness level, and environmental factors including altitude adjustments for heart rate maximums and geographic location-based physiological variations.

    The demographic and environmental parameters feed into constraint definition module (904), which establishes physiological plausibility boundaries for each biometric measurement type. Constraint definitions are mathematically encoded through R1CS transformation (906), converting logical health validation rules into arithmetic constraint systems over finite fields. The R1CS transformation module generates constraint matrices with operational elements including addition, subtraction, equality, and inequality operators arranged in sparse matrix configurations for computational efficiency.

    Biometric data and demographic parameters are simultaneously processed through parallel R1CS transformation (908), creating witness values that satisfy the constraint satisfaction requirements. The compiled constraint circuits are then processed through cryptographic proof generation protocols (910), supporting both Groth16 implementation for production efficiency and STARK-based systems for transparency and quantum resistance. The protocol selection depends on application requirements including proof size constraints, verification speed requirements, and computational resource availability.

    The final proof output (912) contains cryptographic attestations demonstrating constraint satisfaction without revealing underlying biometric values, transmitted to blockchain storage layer for immutable verification record maintenance. This workflow enables privacy-preserving health verification suitable for regulatory compliance, clinical trial validation, and institutional health monitoring applications while maintaining complete patient data confidentiality.
