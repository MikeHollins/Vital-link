BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates generally to the fields of digital data processing and cryptographic asset management. More particularly, the invention pertains to systems and methods that combine machine learning for privacy-preserving data sanitization with blockchain technology for creating verifiable and tradeable digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), within environments governed by regulatory compliance frameworks.
Description of Related Art
[0002] Current health data monetization systems suffer from privacy violations and regulatory compliance failures. Furthermore, the state of the art includes explorations into related technologies. For instance, academic frameworks like 'RedactOR' by Singh et al. teach methods for de-identifying text using Large Language Models while preserving semantic context. Concurrently, patents like U.S. Pat. No. 11,782,942 to Liang et al. teach methods for linking unstructured clinical notes to structured data resources.
[0003] However, none of these references, alone or in combination, teach the specific, sequential process of the present invention. Specifically, the prior art does not disclose a method wherein the semantically preserved, sanitized text itself is used as the direct input for a programmatic data encoder to create a new layer of structured, ontology-mapped metadata, which is then made verifiable and tradeable via an NFT. This unique step of structuring the privacy-preserved output solves the critical problem of creating a data asset that is simultaneously safe for analysis, structurally queryable, and verifiably compliant.
[0004] While the prior art teaches these techniques in isolation—AI-driven de-identification for privacy, ontology mapping for interoperability, and NFT linking for asset representation—they have remained siloed solutions to distinct problems. The art has failed to recognize or solve the more complex technical challenge of creating a single, atomic, and verifiably compliant digital asset ab initio (from the beginning). A simple combination of these known elements would result in a disjointed process, failing to produce a cryptographically bound asset where the token itself serves as an immutable representation of a specific, multi-stage data transformation, rather than merely a pointer to a static data file.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005] The present invention provides a system and method for the creation of verifiable digital health assets suitable for secure presentation, transfer, or trade.  In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises: receiving, at a hardware processor, a digital health attestation comprising descriptive text; programmatically transforming the descriptive text into sanitized data by using a machine learning model to redact protected health information (PHI); programmatically generating a new structured metadata object in an off-chain environment from the sanitized data by mapping a health-related fact to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology; and minting, by a smart contract engine, a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, wherein the NFT embeds an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain structured metadata object. In another embodiment, a system for performing this method is provided, comprising: a data ingestion module configured to receive the attestation; an AI-powered pattern recognition engine configured to programmatically transform the descriptive text; a healthcare standards encoder configured to programmatically generate the new, off-chain structured metadata object; and a smart contract engine configured to mint the NFT with the exclusive immutable link.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0010] The following detailed description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. For purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature and embodiments are set forth to provide a thorough understanding. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. The descriptions of specific embodiments are provided for purpose of illustration and representation, not limitation.
Terminology and Definitions
[0011] To ensure clarity and to control the interpretation of the claims appended hereto, the following terms are defined as follows:
[0012] "Digital Health Attestation" refers to a digital record originating from a verifiable source that confirms a specific health-related fact about a subject and comprises descriptive text. In various embodiments, such attestations may include, but are not limited to, digitally signed vaccination records, authenticated lab results from a certified laboratory, authenticated text streams from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, or data streams from a verified wearable biometric sensor. In a preferred embodiment, the attestation is a cryptographic proof, such as a zero-knowledge proof, that enables verification of compliance with a set of health parameters without exposing the underlying raw data. Such a proof may be generated from a cryptographic circuit that is dynamically configured based on environmental metadata, such as geographic location or jurisdictional compliance logic, to ensure context-aware validation.
[0013] "Protected Health Information (PHI)" is defined in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its associated regulations. It includes any information in a medical record that can be used to identify an individual, and that was created, used, or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service.
[0014] "Healthcare Ontology" refers to a formal, standardized system of names, definitions, and categories that represents the concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10. The use of such an ontology enables semantic interoperability for the data processed by the system.
[0015] "Sanitized Descriptive Data" refers to the output generated by the AI-powered pattern recognition engine after it has programmatically transformed the descriptive text of a digital health attestation by identifying and redacting PHI while preserving the underlying semantic context.
[0016] "Structured Metadata Object" refers to a new, discrete digital data structure programmatically generated by the healthcare standards encoder. This object is created from the sanitized descriptive data by mapping a health-related fact therein to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. Critically, this object is created and stored in an off-chain environment and may comprise not only the ontology codes but also a cryptographic hash of the sanitized descriptive data from which it was generated, a timestamp of its creation, and a reference to the specific AI model and ontology version used in its transformation. It represents a verifiable record of a data transformation event.
[0017] "Non-Fungible Token (NFT)" refers to a unique cryptographic token residing on a blockchain. In the context of the present invention, an NFT serves as a verifiable and tradeable representation of a sanitized health attestation and contains an immutable link pointing exclusively to its corresponding off-chain Structured Metadata Object. The term 'Non-Fungible Token (NFT)' is used herein to refer to its primary function as a unique, blockchain-based cryptographic token that represents ownership or serves as a unique identifier for a specific digital asset. It is intended to encompass not only tokens compliant with the ERC-721 standard but also any functionally equivalent token standards that may now exist or be developed in the future, including but not limited to semi-fungible tokens (e.g., ERC-1155) or other protocols for creating unique digital representations on a distributed ledger.
[0018] A primary technical barrier preventing the tokenization of health data is the significant legal and privacy risk of immutably recording PHI on a public, distributed ledger. The present invention overcomes this barrier by providing a specific, non-obvious architectural solution that programmatically transforms health data into a verifiable and tradeable token without ever exposing PHI to the blockchain. The system is architected to perform a specific sequence of off-chain transformations prior to any on-chain transaction, thereby creating a new type of digital health asset that is verifiably compliant by design.
[0019] Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrating the overall system architecture (100) is shown. The system comprises a Data Ingestion Module (110) configured to receive a digital health attestation; an AI-Powered Pattern Recognition Engine (120) configured to programmatically transform descriptive text into sanitized descriptive data; a Healthcare Standards Encoder (130) configured to programmatically generate a new, off-chain structured metadata object; and a Smart Contract Engine (140) configured to mint an NFT with an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain object.
[0020] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 1 Architecture: Consider a large-scale, post-market surveillance study for a new pharmaceutical drug. A pharmaceutical company needs to gather real-world evidence of drug efficacy and side effects from thousands of patients. Using the system (100), a patient can authorize the ingestion of their physician's notes (a digital health attestation). The system processes these notes, redacting all PHI, and creates a token representing, for example, "Patient experienced symptom X (SNOMED code: 12345) after taking drug Y." The pharmaceutical company can then purchase these verifiable, privacy-preserving tokens at scale, creating a dataset of unprecedented quality for their research and FDA reporting, while the patient is compensated for contributing their anonymized data. This solves a multi-billion dollar problem for drug development.
[00221] It is to be understood that the immutable link 'pointing exclusively to the new structured metadata object' is meant to define the primary, substantive purpose of the link, which is to identify and provide access to the verifiable record of the data transformation event. The presence of other, ancillary data or links within the token's metadata, which are unrelated to the core function of identifying the structured metadata object, would not preclude the primary link from being considered exclusive in its function. The inventive step is the creation of a token whose primary purpose is to serve as an immutable pointer to this specific, newly generated evidentiary object.
[0022] Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart illustrates the core data transformation process. The process begins with a Verified Health Attestation (210). It undergoes AI-Powered PHI Sanitization (220) to produce sanitized data. The data then undergoes Ontology-Based Metadata Encoding (230) to generate the new structured metadata object. A Cryptographic Commitment (240) (e.g., a hash) is generated, and the process culminates in NFT Minting (250) to create the Compliant Health NFT (260). The resulting structured metadata object is therefore more than just a collection of codes; it is an immutable evidentiary record of the entire transformation process, cryptographically linking the sanitized data to the structured output.
[0023] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 2 Data Transformation: A health insurance company wishes to offer personalized wellness incentives. A user connects their wearable fitness device, which generates a stream of data including workout notes ("Completed a strenuous 5k run today"). This stream is a Verified Health Attestation (210). The system processes this note via Sanitization (220) and Encoding (230) to create a structured object representing "Attestation of moderate-to-high cardiovascular activity." An NFT is minted (250). The user can submit this token to their insurer as verifiable proof of meeting a wellness goal, unlocking a premium discount. The insurer receives only the verified, relevant fact without accessing the user's full, sensitive health profile, thus maintaining privacy while reducing risk and operational overhead.
[0024] Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrates a preferred embodiment using a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). A Dynamic ZK Verification System (310) generates a Context-Aware ZKP Attestation (320), which serves as the input to the NFTME System (330) (representing the overall system of the invention).
[0025] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 3 Synergistic Operation: A government agency or airline requires proof of compliance with a health mandate (e.g., a specific vaccination) for travel. A user, not wishing to disclose their entire medical history, uses the ZK Verification System (310) to generate a proof (320) that cryptographically attests they meet the mandate's criteria without revealing any other information. This ZKP is the input to the NFTME System (330), which then creates a token representing "Holder has a valid travel health credential." The user can present this token to the agency, which can verify it on the blockchain, preserving the user's privacy completely.
[0067] Referring to FIG. 4, a diagram illustrates an exemplary data structure for the metadata that can be associated with the NFT. The structure may comprise fields such as attestation_type (410), subject_attestation_hash (420), the immutable_link (430) to the full off-chain object, and a validation_method (440).
[0027] Illustrative Use-Case for FIG. 4 Metadata Structure: A decentralized clinical trial platform wants to recruit participants who meet specific criteria. Researchers can programmatically scan the blockchain for tokens whose metadata contains specific values. For instance, a query could seek tokens where attestation_type (410) is 'Authenticated Lab Result' and the off-chain data (referenced by immutable_link (430)) contains a specific ontology code for a biomarker. This allows for highly efficient, privacy-preserving patient discovery, as researchers can identify qualifying anonymous tokens and then invite the token holders to participate.
[0028] The Smart Contract Engine (140) can be configured with additional logic modules to enhance the functionality of the minted NFT. For instance, a dynamic Attestation Distinctiveness Score (ADS) Module may be included. This computer-implemented module programmatically calculates a numerical ADS by comparing the ontology-mapped structured metadata of the attestation against a historical database of previously processed attestations to determine statistical novelty, thereby providing a metric for the asset's potential value for research or analysis.
[0029] In other embodiments, the smart contract may implement a time-locking mechanism, wherein the NFT is non-transferable until a specific on-chain or off-chain condition is met, verified via an oracle. Furthermore, the system may execute a cryptographic revocation mechanism, wherein a user-initiated data erasure request triggers an update to a public revocation list or a state change in the smart contract, thereby allowing verifiers to confirm that the immutable link within the NFT is no longer considered valid. The non-fungible token (NFT) described herein is an embodiment of a programmable, verifiable digital asset. The scope of the invention is not limited to NFTs that serve merely as a pointer to an off-chain object. It is contemplated that the token itself may evolve into a dynamic digital asset or a 'smart container.' In future embodiments, the token's metadata may be updatable by trusted oracles based on real-world events, or the token's underlying smart contract may be endowed with additional functionalities, such as the ability to interact with other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or to trigger further automated workflows upon its transfer or verification. The core inventive concept is the use of a unique, blockchain-based token to serve as an immutable and verifiable representation of a compliant data transformation process.
[0030] The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto.

ABSTRACT
A method and system for generating a regulatory-compliant health data token. A digital health attestation is received at a hardware processor. A machine learning model programmatically transforms descriptive text from the attestation into sanitized data by redacting protected health information (PHI) while preserving semantic context. In an off-chain environment, a new structured metadata object is programmatically generated from the sanitized data by mapping a health-related fact to one or more codes from a healthcare ontology. A smart contract engine then mints a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain, where the NFT embeds an immutable link pointing exclusively to the off-chain structured metadata object. This specific architectural solution solves the technical problem of placing PHI on a blockchain while maintaining semantic interoperability, enabling the creation of verifiable digital health assets suitable for secure presentation, transfer, or trade.
