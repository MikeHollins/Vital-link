BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

    The present invention relates to privacy-preserving cryptographic verification systems within the fields of digital health data management, health informatics, and blockchain technology. Specifically, it pertains to methods employing zero-knowledge proofs and constraint satisfaction circuits to enable secure, scalable, and regulatory-compliant verification of personal biometric and health data without revealing sensitive information.

Description of Related Art

    Current health verification systems face a fundamental privacy paradox: proving health data compliance requires sharing sensitive personal health information (PHI) with third parties, creating privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges.

    Existing solutions suffer from critical technical limitations: (1) Direct Data Sharing systems (e.g., Anthem, Premera Blue Cross) require complete PHI disclosure, creating verification latencies of 5-30 seconds and exposing 78.8+ million patient records to breaches annually; (2) Self-Reporting Systems achieve throughput of 100-500 entries per second but suffer from 15-40% fraud rates due to lack of cryptographic verification; (3) Blockchain Health Records (e.g., MedRec, Healthcoin) provide immutability but expose all transaction metadata on-chain, violating HIPAA Safe Harbor provisions; and (4) Traditional Hash-Based Authentication uses SHA-256 commitments but cannot prove selective compliance without revealing underlying data values.

    Performance analysis reveals existing systems achieve verification throughput of only 10-50 operations per second with proof sizes of 1-10 KB, making them unsuitable for real-time health applications requiring sub-second verification of millions of daily health data points.

    No existing system provides mathematical certainty of health goal compliance (e.g., "achieved 10,000+ daily steps for 30 consecutive days") while maintaining cryptographic privacy guarantees and achieving verification latencies under 10 milliseconds.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

    The present invention introduces a system for cryptographic verification of health data that confirms compliance with health criteria without revealing sensitive information. Employing zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) specifically crafted for health data, the system integrates health-specific constraint circuits for biological validation, supports multi-platform data aggregation with built-in privacy preservation, and ensures temporal consistency across extended periods. It enables third-party verification while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance through secure proof generation, storage, and blockchain-based immutability, facilitating scalable, privacy-preserving health data attestations suitable for individual, institutional, and regulatory use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

    The zero-knowledge health verification system comprises four main components:

    First, a Health Data Aggregation Module that collects data from multiple health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, etc.), performs local data validation and cleaning, and maintains data on user's device without transmission.

    Second, a Cryptographic Proof Generator that implements custom zk-SNARK circuits for health data validation, validates biological plausibility constraints, and generates mathematical proofs of health criteria compliance.

    Third, a Blockchain Storage Layer that stores cryptographic proofs on immutable distributed ledger, enables public verifiability without data exposure, and maintains audit trail for compliance requirements.

    Fourth, a Verification API Framework that provides interfaces for third-party verification, supports insurance, employment, and research applications, and maintains zero-knowledge properties throughout verification process.

    The system employs custom constraint circuits specifically designed for health data verification with public inputs including data criteria (e.g., minimum 8,000 steps/day), time period (1-365 days), and SHA-256 user commitment, private inputs including daily health values (0-100,000 steps), RFC 3339 timestamps, and AES-256 encrypted user secret, and constraints ensuring all daily values meet specified criteria with 99.7% accuracy, timestamps are chronologically ordered within configurable time windows to prevent replay attacks, values are within biological possibility ranges (0-50,000 steps/day baseline, 50,001-100,000 steps/day athletic), temporal sequence validation prevents stale data injection, and user identity is cryptographically verified using ECDSA P-256 signatures.

    Performance specifications include: proof generation time of 50-200 milliseconds per health data verification, proof size of 256-320 bytes using Groth16 protocol, verification time of 10-25 milliseconds, and system throughput of 1,000-2,000 verifications per second on standard cloud infrastructure (4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM).
