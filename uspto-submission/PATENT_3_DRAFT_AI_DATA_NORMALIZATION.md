**Title:** Artificial Intelligence System for Real-Time Health Data Normalization Across Heterogeneous Platforms

**Inventors:** [Your Name]

**Filing Date:** [Current Date]

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to health data interoperability, machine learning-based data fusion, real-time conflict resolution, and automated platform integration systems for health monitoring applications.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Modern health monitoring involves multiple disparate platforms and devices, each with different data formats, measurement units, temporal granularities, and accuracy levels. Current limitations include:

1. **Data Silos:** Health data remains isolated within individual platforms, preventing comprehensive health insights.

2. **Format Incompatibility:** Different platforms use incompatible data schemas, units, and temporal structures.

3. **Measurement Conflicts:** Multiple devices measuring the same health metric often produce conflicting values without resolution mechanisms.

4. **Manual Integration:** Adding new health platforms requires months of manual development for each integration.

5. **Quality Assessment:** No systematic approach exists for assessing and improving health data quality across platforms.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides an artificial intelligence-powered system that automatically normalizes health data from disparate sources, resolves conflicts between measurements, and provides unified health insights. The system employs machine learning algorithms to understand new health platforms and automatically generate integration adapters.

Key innovations include:
- AI-powered semantic mapping for automatic data format translation
- Machine learning-based conflict resolution with device accuracy weighting
- Biological plausibility validation for data quality assurance
- Self-learning platform integration that generates adapters automatically
- Predictive quality assessment using historical data patterns

### Novel Conflict Resolution Algorithm

```typescript
AI Conflict Resolution Process:
1. Conflict Classification:
   - Measurement variance (small differences)
   - Temporal misalignment (timing differences)
   - Device accuracy differences (known reliability gaps)
   - Unit inconsistencies (format/scale differences)

2. ML Weight Calculation:
   - Historical device accuracy for specific metrics
   - Temporal proximity to conflict resolution time
   - User-specific device reliability patterns
   - Biological plausibility of measurements

3. Weighted Resolution:
   - Apply calculated weights to conflicting measurements
   - Validate result against physiological constraints
   - Generate confidence score for resolved value
