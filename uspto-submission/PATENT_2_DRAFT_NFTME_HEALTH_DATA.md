# Patent Application 2: NFTme Health Data Tokenization System

## Provisional Patent Application

**Title:** NFTme: Blockchain-Based Health Data Tokenization System with HIPAA-Compliant Metadata

**Inventors:** [Your Name]

**Filing Date:** [Current Date]

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to non-fungible token (NFT) systems, blockchain-based credentialing, and healthcare compliance, specifically systems for converting health data into tradeable digital assets while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Current health credentialing and data systems suffer from several limitations:

1. **Lack of Portability:** Health datas are typically siloed within specific platforms or healthcare systems, making them non-transferable when users switch providers or platforms.

2. **Verification Challenges:** Health datas cannot be independently verified without access to the original health data, creating trust issues for employers, insurers, and other stakeholders.

3. **No Economic Value:** Health data provides no monetary benefit to users, reducing motivation for sustained healthy behaviors.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Existing blockchain health systems violate HIPAA and other privacy regulations by storing protected health information on public ledgers.

5. **Fraud Susceptibility:** Self-reported health datas cannot be verified, leading to widespread fraud in wellness programs.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The NFTme system provides a novel method for converting verified health data into blockchain-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while maintaining healthcare regulatory compliance. The NFTme platform creates tradeable digital assets representing health information, datas, and medical data without storing protected health information on public blockchains.

Key innovations include:
- Automated PHI detection and sanitization algorithms
- HIPAA-compliant metadata generation for blockchain storage
- Smart contract-based business associate agreements
- Marketplace integration with healthcare compliance
- Royalty distribution for ongoing data value

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

   - Implements medical-grade verification for clinical datas

2. **PHI Sanitization System**
   - Automatically detects protected health information in data data
   - Employs machine learning algorithms trained on healthcare data patterns
   - Generates HIPAA-compliant metadata suitable for blockchain storage

3. **NFTme Minting Infrastructure**

### Dependent Claim 5
The system of claim 4, wherein the smart contract implements dynamic rarity scoring that automatically adjusts based on data completion rates across the user population.

### Dependent Claim 6
The system of claim 4, wherein the PHI detection employs natural language processing algorithms trained specifically on healthcare terminology and regulatory compliance patterns.

### Dependent Claim 7
The system of claim 4, wherein the marketplace integration includes cross-chain compatibility enabling health data NFTs to be traded across multiple blockchain networks.

### Dependent Claim 8
The system of claim 4, wherein the smart contract implements time-locked data verification requiring sustained health behavior over specified periods before NFT minting.

### Dependent Claim 9
The system of claim 4, wherein the royalty distribution system automatically splits revenue between multiple stakeholders including health platforms, verification services, and data creators.

### Dependent Claim 10
The system of claim 4, wherein the NFT smart contract implements GDPR-compliant token burning mechanisms for "right to erasure" requests while maintaining blockchain immutability through cryptographic proof preservation.

## NOVEL SMART CONTRACT ARCHITECTURE

### NFTme Health Achievement Contract

```solidity
contract NFTmeHealthAchievement is ERC721, AccessControl {
    struct HealthAchievement {
        string dataType;     // "Fitness Milestone"
        uint256 difficultyLevel;    // 1-10 scale
        uint256 timeToComplete;     // Days required
        string verificationMethod;  // "Medical" | "Device" | "ZK-Proof"
        uint256 rarityScore;        // Calculated rarity 0-1000
        bytes32 zkProofHash;        // Zero-knowledge verification
        bool isPHICompliant;        // Automated PHI check result
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => HealthAchievement) public datas;
    
    function mintHealthAchievement(
        address recipient,
        HealthAchievement memory data,
        bytes calldata phiComplianceProof
    ) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) returns (uint256) {
        require(data.isPHICompliant, "PHI detected in data");
        require(verifyPHICompliance(data, phiComplianceProof), "PHI compliance verification failed");
        
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        
        _safeMint(recipient, tokenId);
        datas[tokenId] = data;
        
        emit HealthAchievementMinted(tokenId, recipient, data.dataType);
        return tokenId;
    }
}
```

### Automated PHI Detection Algorithm

```typescript
class HIPAAPHIDetector {
    private static readonly PHI_PATTERNS = [
        /\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b/,                    // SSN
        /\b[A-Z0-9]{10,20}\b/,                      // Medical record numbers
        /\b\d+\.\d{2,}\s*(bpm|mmHg|kg|lbs)\b/,     // Precise measurements
        /\b(diabetes|hypertension|cancer|depression)\b/i, // Specific diagnoses
        /\b\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}\b/      // Precise timestamps
    ];
    
    static sanitizeForBlockchain(data: any): SanitizedData {
        const dataString = JSON.stringify(data);
        
        for (const pattern of this.PHI_PATTERNS) {
            if (pattern.test(dataString)) {
                throw new PHIViolationError(`Protected health information detected: ${pattern}`);
            }
        }
        
        return {
            sanitizedMetadata: this.createSafeMetadata(data),
            complianceVerified: true,
            sanitizationTimestamp: new Date()
        };
    }
}
```

### Novel PHI Detection Algorithm

```typescript
PHI Detection Patterns:
- Social Security Numbers: /\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b/
- Medical Record Numbers: /\b[A-Z0-9]{10,20}\b/
- Precise Health Measurements: /\b\d+\.\d{2,}\s*(bpm|mmHg|kg)\b/
- Specific Diagnoses: /\b(diabetes|hypertension|cancer)\b/i
- Exact Timestamps: /\b\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}\b/

Sanitization Process:
1. Scan data data for PHI patterns
2. Reject any data containing protected information
3. Generate generalized metadata (e.g., "Fitness Goal" instead of "10,247 steps")
4. Create verification hash linking to off-chain proof
5. Mint NFT with compliant metadata only
```
