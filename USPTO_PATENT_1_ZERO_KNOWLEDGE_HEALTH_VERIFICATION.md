Background of the Invention

Field of the Invention

This invention relates to computer-implemented methods for health data verification, specifically cryptographic proof systems that enable verification of health data and medical criteria without exposing sensitive personal health information.

Description of Related Art

Current health verification systems face a fundamental privacy paradox: proving health data compliance requires sharing sensitive personal health information (PHI) with third parties, creating privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges. 

Existing solutions include: (1) Direct Data Sharing where insurance companies, employers, and healthcare providers require access to complete health records for verification, violating privacy principles and creating HIPAA compliance risks; (2) Self-Reporting Systems where users manually report health data without verification, leading to fraud and unreliable data; (3) Blockchain Health Records that store health data directly on public ledgers, violating healthcare privacy regulations and exposing sensitive information permanently; and (4) Traditional Authentication that uses centralized authorities requiring full access to health data for verification.

None of these approaches solve the core problem: how to cryptographically prove health data compliance while maintaining complete privacy of the underlying health measurements.

Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a revolutionary approach for generating cryptographic proofs that verify health data criteria without exposing sensitive health data. The system employs zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) specifically designed for health data verification.

The invention includes health-specific constraint circuits for biological validation, multi-platform data aggregation with privacy preservation, temporal consistency verification across extended time periods, third-party verification without data exposure, and HIPAA-compliant proof generation and storage.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The zero-knowledge health verification system comprises four main components:

First, a Health Data Aggregation Module that collects data from multiple health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, etc.), performs local data validation and cleaning, and maintains data on user's device without transmission.

Second, a Cryptographic Proof Generator that implements custom zk-SNARK circuits for health data validation, validates biological plausibility constraints, and generates mathematical proofs of health criteria compliance.

Third, a Blockchain Storage Layer that stores cryptographic proofs on immutable distributed ledger, enables public verifiability without data exposure, and maintains audit trail for compliance requirements.

Fourth, a Verification API Framework that provides interfaces for third-party verification, supports insurance, employment, and research applications, and maintains zero-knowledge properties throughout verification process.

The system employs custom constraint circuits specifically designed for health data verification with public inputs including data criteria, time period, and user commitment, private inputs including daily health values, timestamps, and user secret, and constraints ensuring all daily values meet specified criteria, timestamps are chronologically ordered, values are within biological possibility ranges, and user identity is cryptographically verified.
