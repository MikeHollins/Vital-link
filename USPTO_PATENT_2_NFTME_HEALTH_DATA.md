Background of the Invention

Field of the Invention

This invention relates to non-fungible token (NFT) systems, blockchain-based credentialing, and healthcare compliance, specifically systems for converting health data into tradeable digital assets while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Description of Related Art

Current health credentialing and data systems suffer from several limitations: (1) Lack of Portability where health data is typically siloed within specific platforms or healthcare systems, making it non-transferable when users switch providers or platforms; (2) Verification Challenges where health data cannot be independently verified without access to the original health information, creating trust issues for employers, insurers, and other stakeholders; (3) No Economic Value where health data provides no monetary benefit to data owners, reducing motivation for sustained healthy behaviors; (4) Regulatory Compliance where existing blockchain health systems violate HIPAA and other privacy regulations by storing protected health information on public ledgers; and (5) Fraud Susceptibility where self-reported health data cannot be verified, leading to widespread fraud in wellness programs.

Summary of the Invention

The NFTme system provides a novel method for converting verified health data into blockchain-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while maintaining healthcare regulatory compliance. The NFTme platform creates tradeable digital assets representing health information and medical data without storing protected health information on public blockchains.

Key innovations include automated PHI detection and sanitization algorithms, HIPAA-compliant metadata generation for blockchain storage, smart contract-based business associate agreements, marketplace integration with healthcare compliance, and royalty distribution for ongoing data value.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The NFTme system comprises four core components:

First, a Data Verification Engine that validates health data from multiple data sources, employs zero-knowledge proofs for verification without data exposure, and implements medical-grade verification for clinical data.

Second, a PHI Sanitization System that automatically detects protected health information in data, employs machine learning algorithms trained on healthcare data patterns, and generates HIPAA-compliant metadata suitable for blockchain storage.

Third, NFTme Minting Infrastructure that creates ERC-721 compliant tokens with health-specific metadata standards, implements smart contracts with healthcare compliance validation, and provides immutable data records with verification proofs.

Fourth, Marketplace Integration that enables trading of NFTme health data tokens with regulatory compliance, implements royalty systems for data creators, and provides valuation algorithms based on data rarity and utility.

The system implements automated PHI detection preventing storage of protected health information using natural language processing algorithms trained specifically on healthcare terminology and regulatory compliance patterns.

Claims

1. A method performed by a computing device for generating blockchain-anchored, privacy-preserving health data tokens, comprising:  
   receiving verified health data and achievement attestations from trusted health monitoring sources and medical systems;
   automatically sanitizing said data using trained pattern recognition and machine learning models to redact protected health information (PHI) and identifiers, without disclosing detailed health measurements;
   encoding achievement metadata in a standardized format using healthcare ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) that describe health outcomes and attestations without revealing measurement specifics;
   cryptographically committing to the sanitized data and achievement metadata using commitment schemes suitable for zero-knowledge proof generation;
   minting blockchain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) compliant with ERC-721 or similar standards, embedding cryptographic commitments and metadata; and
   supporting marketplace trading, revenue sharing, and regulatory features—including user data erasure and cryptographic proof validation—across multiple blockchain networks.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the sanitization employs machine learning classifiers trained on healthcare datasets to accurately detect and redact PHI, identifiers, and sensitive health information, achieving over 99% accuracy.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein the achievement metadata encodes health outcomes, thresholds, and attestations using healthcare standards such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10, without exposing detailed measurement data.

4. The method of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic commitments are designed to support zero-knowledge proofs, enabling third-party verification of achievement attestations without revealing underlying health data.

5. The method of claim 1, wherein the minting includes generating time-locked NFTs that require demonstration of sustained health behaviors over predefined periods before being valid for marketplace transfer.

6. The method of claim 1, wherein the system supports cross-chain interoperability, allowing health data tokens to be securely traded and verified across multiple blockchain protocols.

7. The method of claim 1, wherein the smart contract architecture incorporates a dynamic rarity scoring system that adjusts token rarity based on achievement novelty, data completeness, or participant engagement levels.

8. The method of claim 1, wherein the system employs cryptographic proof revocation mechanisms to support user-initiated data erasure requests in compliance with GDPR and similar privacy regulations.

9. The method of claim 1, further comprising automated smart contract execution for revenue sharing among stakeholders—including health data providers, verification services, and content creators—based on achievement validation and marketplace transactions.

10. The method of claim 1, wherein achievement validation involves cryptographic proof generation using zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs), tailored for health data verification circuits.

11. A blockchain-based health achievement token system comprising:  
    a data ingestion module receiving verified health measurements from multiple trusted sources;
    an AI-powered pattern recognition engine trained to detect and redact PHI;
    a healthcare-standard encoder generating achievement metadata compliant with SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD standards;
    a cryptographic commitment module supporting zero-knowledge proof creation;
    a smart contract engine for minting ERC-721 tokens, managing royalties, and enforcing compliance features such as data erasure and cross-chain interoperability; and
    an API for third-party verification that confirms achievement validity without access to raw health data.

12. The system of claim 11, wherein the pattern recognition engine employs deep NLP trained specifically on healthcare regulatory language to detect PHI with high accuracy and low false positives.

13. The system of claim 11, wherein the achievement metadata encoding supports compliance with GDPR, including consent management, data access, and right-to-erasure functionalities.

14. The system of claim 11, wherein the cryptographic commitment module generates proofs that are compatible with zero-knowledge proof protocols, enabling third-party validation in a privacy-preserving manner.

Abstract

A blockchain-based system for converting verified health data into tradeable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that comply with HIPAA and GDPR regulations. The system automatically detects and sanitizes protected health information (PHI) using trained machine learning models and natural language processing algorithms, ensuring privacy. It generates standardized, HIPAA-compatible metadata describing health achievements using healthcare ontologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, or ICD-10, without revealing sensitive measurement data. The system employs cryptographic commitments and integrates zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification, allowing third parties to authenticate health attestations without accessing raw health measurements. The architecture supports secure, cross-chain marketplace trading with automated royalty distribution, dynamic rarity scoring based on achievement uniqueness, and GDPR-compliant data erasure and proof revocation. This innovative platform ensures trusted, regulatory-compliant health data tokenization, enabling transparent and secure digital health credentialing and data monetization.
