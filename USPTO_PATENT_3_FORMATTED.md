BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

    This invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for real-time normalization and conflict resolution of health data collected from diverse platforms with incompatible schemas and data formats.

Description of Related Art

    Current health data integration systems suffer from fundamental interoperability challenges when attempting to normalize data from heterogeneous platforms. Existing approaches include: (1) Manual Data Mapping that requires extensive human intervention to resolve schema differences, creating scalability limitations and error-prone processes; (2) Static Integration APIs that break when platforms update their data formats, requiring constant maintenance and manual reconfiguration; (3) Simple Data Aggregation that combines data without resolving conflicts, leading to inconsistent and unreliable health insights; and (4) Centralized Data Warehouses that require all platforms to conform to a single schema, limiting platform diversity and innovation.

    None of these solutions provide automated, intelligent resolution of conflicting health measurements while maintaining real-time processing capabilities and privacy preservation across multiple client deployments.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

    The present invention provides an AI-driven system for real-time normalization and conflict resolution of health data collected from diverse platforms with incompatible schemas and formats. The system employs advanced semantic analysis including deep neural networks trained on healthcare ontologies to automatically map heterogeneous data to a standardized healthcare data model.

    Key innovations include deep neural networks trained on healthcare ontologies, machine learning algorithms with adaptive weighting based on device reliability, federated learning for privacy-preserving model improvements, automatic schema change detection, and HL7 FHIR compatible output with quantifiable confidence intervals.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

    The AI normalization system comprises seven main components:

    First, a Heterogeneous Platform Interface that concurrently receives health measurements from multiple data sources, each with distinct data schemas, units, and temporal granularities.

    Second, a Semantic Analysis Engine that employs deep neural networks trained on healthcare ontologies to automatically map each source's data schema to a unified healthcare standard schema.

    Third, a Conflict Resolution Module that detects and resolves conflicts among overlapping measurements using machine learning algorithms that adaptively weight data sources based on historical reliability metrics, device performance scores, and contextual parameters.

    Fourth, a Federated Learning Framework that collaboratively improves schema mapping and conflict resolution models across multiple client devices while preserving privacy by avoiding sharing raw data.

    Fifth, a Normalization Engine that synthesizes consistent, high-confidence health data streams with associated confidence scores and confidence intervals indicating measurement reliability.

    Sixth, a Compliance Management System that implements GDPR and HIPAA compliance through consent management, encrypted data handling, and data portability features integrated into the normalization pipeline.

    Seventh, an Output Interface that provides real-time health insights and analytics derived from the normalized, conflict-resolved data in HL7 FHIR compatible format.

    The system implements biological plausibility validation with physiological ranges including heart rate (30-220 BPM with context awareness), daily steps (0-100,000 with temporal validation), sleep duration (60-1080 minutes with circadian awareness), and weight change (maximum 0.5kg daily variation under normal circumstances).
