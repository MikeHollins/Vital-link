Background of the Invention

Field of the Invention

This invention relates to health data interoperability, machine learning-based data fusion, real-time conflict resolution, and automated platform integration systems for health monitoring applications.

Description of Related Art

Modern health monitoring involves multiple disparate platforms and devices, each with different data formats, measurement units, temporal granularities, and accuracy levels. Current limitations include: (1) Data Silos where health data remains isolated within individual platforms, preventing comprehensive health insights; (2) Format Incompatibility where different platforms use incompatible data schemas, units, and temporal structures; (3) Measurement Conflicts where multiple devices measuring the same health metric often produce conflicting values without resolution mechanisms; (4) Manual Integration where adding new health platforms requires months of manual development for each integration; and (5) Quality Assessment where no systematic approach exists for assessing and improving health data quality across platforms.

Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides an artificial intelligence-powered system that automatically normalizes health data from disparate sources, resolves conflicts between measurements, and provides unified health insights. The system employs machine learning algorithms to understand new health platforms and automatically generate integration adapters.

Key innovations include AI-powered semantic mapping for automatic data format translation, machine learning-based conflict resolution with device accuracy weighting, biological plausibility validation for data quality assurance, self-learning platform integration that generates adapters automatically, and predictive quality assessment using historical data patterns.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The AI-powered system comprises four main components:

First, a Semantic Mapping Engine that automatically identifies health data patterns in unknown schemas, employs natural language processing for field name analysis, and generates mapping rules between source and target formats.

Second, an Intelligent Conflict Resolution module that detects conflicts between simultaneous health measurements, applies machine learning-trained weights based on device accuracy, and validates resolved values against biological plausibility constraints.

Third, an Auto-Integration Framework that analyzes new platform APIs and data structures automatically, generates integration adapters without manual programming, and tests and validates generated adapters with sample data.

Fourth, a Quality Prediction System that predicts data reliability before processing using ML models, flags anomalous readings based on user patterns and device characteristics, and provides confidence scores for all normalized data points.

The system implements biological plausibility validation with physiological ranges including heart rate (30-220 BPM with context awareness), daily steps (0-100,000 with temporal validation), sleep duration (60-1080 minutes with circadian awareness), and weight change (maximum 0.5kg daily variation under normal circumstances).

Abstract

This invention presents an AI-driven system for real-time normalization and conflict resolution of health data collected from diverse platforms with incompatible schemas and formats. The system employs advanced semantic analysis—including deep neural networks trained on healthcare ontologies—to automatically map heterogeneous data to a standardized healthcare data model. It dynamically detects and resolves conflicting measurements using machine learning algorithms that adaptively weight data sources based on device reliability, contextual parameters, and biological plausibility constraints embedded in specialized circuits. The architecture ensures high-confidence, standardized health streams with quantifiable confidence intervals, supporting real-time insights while maintaining strict adherence to privacy and regulatory standards such as GDPR and HIPAA. Key features include automatic schema change detection, federated learning for privacy-preserving improvements, and regulatory-compliant data erasure and portability mechanisms. By integrating these innovations, the system provides scalable, accurate, and interoperable health data solutions for clinicians, researchers, and consumers, overcoming prior limitations of data silos, incompatibility, and conflicting measurements.
